Please generate tasks from a PRD using /ai-dev-tasks/generate-tasks.md

If not explicitly told which PRD to use:
1. List available PRDs in /tasks/ directory (files starting with prd-)
2. Ask which PRD to use for task generation
3. Check if tasks already exist for that PRD

Process:
1. Read and analyze the specified PRD
2. Generate high-level parent tasks first
3. Show me the parent tasks and wait for "Go" to continue
4. Generate detailed sub-tasks for each parent task
5. Save as tasks-[prd-name].md in /tasks/
