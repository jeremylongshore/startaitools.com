Please use the structured workflow in /ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md to help me create a PRD for a new feature.

When creating a PRD:
1. Ask clarifying questions first (provide numbered/lettered options)
2. Generate the PRD based on my answers
3. Save it to /tasks/ directory as prd-[feature-name].md
4. Do NOT start implementing - just create the PRD
