Please use the PRD template from ~/ai-dev/professional-templates/01_prd.md to help me create a Product Requirements Document.

When creating a PRD:
1. Read the template from ~/ai-dev/professional-templates/01_prd.md
2. Ask clarifying questions based on the template structure
3. Generate the PRD with {{DATE}} replaced with current date
4. Save it to completed-docs/[project-name]/ directory
5. Include proper metadata and cross-references to related docs
