Please process the task list using /ai-dev-tasks/process-task-list.md

Rules:
1. Work on ONE sub-task at a time
2. After completing each sub-task, mark it [x] and wait for approval
3. When all sub-tasks under a parent are complete, run tests and commit
4. Only move to next task after I say "yes" or "y"

If no task list specified:
1. List available task lists in /tasks/ (tasks-*.md files)
2. Ask which one to work on
3. Show current progress and next task to complete
