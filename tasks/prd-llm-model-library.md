# Product Requirements Document: LLM Model Library

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the creation of an auto-updating "Best in Class" LLM library feature for the StartAITools website. The library will serve as a highly curated reference focusing exclusively on category leaders - only the top 2-3 models per category. Rather than overwhelming users with choices, it will present the definitive best options for each use case. The library will automatically check for updates and maintain current pricing/performance data from sources like Hugging Face, Models.dev, or other APIs.

## Goals

1. **Create a "Best in Class" LLM reference** featuring only top 2-3 models per category
2. **Focus on practical categories** that developers actually need (coding, chat, local, vision, etc.)
3. **Maintain current pricing and performance data** through auto-updates
4. **Provide clear winner recommendations** for each use case
5. **Keep the list small and decisive** - quality over quantity

## User Stories

1. **As an AI developer**, I want to quickly find suitable LLM models for my project so that I can make informed decisions
2. **As a learner**, I want to understand the landscape of available LLMs and their capabilities
3. **As a site visitor**, I want to see up-to-date information about new model releases
4. **As Jeremy**, I want the library to auto-update so I don't have to manually maintain it
5. **As a budget-conscious developer**, I want to find the best value models based on cost per token and performance
6. **As a local deployment user**, I want to identify lightweight models that can run efficiently on my hardware

## Functional Requirements

1. **Data Source Integration**
   - The system must connect to at least one model source API (Hugging Face, Models.dev, or similar)
   - The system must support multiple data sources for comprehensive coverage
   - The system must handle API rate limits gracefully

2. **Model Information**
   - The system must display model name, creator/organization, and release date
   - The system must show model size, parameters, and architecture type
   - The system must include use case summaries and capabilities
   - The system must provide links to original sources and documentation
   - The system must show licensing information
   - The system must display token pricing information (input/output costs)
   - The system must show performance metrics and benchmarks where available

3. **Model Categories - Best in Class Only**
   Categories limited to (2-3 models each):
   - **Best for Coding**: Top code generation models
   - **Best for Chat**: Leading conversational models
   - **Best for Local**: Lightweight models that run on consumer hardware
   - **Best Value (API)**: Optimal price/performance for cloud APIs
   - **Best for Vision**: Top multimodal models
   - **Best for Long Context**: Models with 100k+ token windows
   - **Best Open Source**: Top freely available models
   - **Best for Speed**: Fastest inference models
   - The system must show resource requirements (RAM, GPU, disk space)
   - The system must calculate and display cost per million tokens
   - The system must clearly mark the #1 choice per category

4. **Auto-Update Mechanism**
   - The system must check for new models daily/weekly (configurable)
   - The system must update existing model information when changes detected
   - The system must update pricing information regularly
   - The system must log update activities for monitoring

5. **Curation Features**
   - The system must allow filtering by model type, size, task, or date
   - The system must support filtering by deployment type (local vs cloud)
   - The system must allow sorting by value metrics (cost per token, performance)
   - The system must support manual curation to highlight important models
   - The system must exclude low-quality or deprecated models

6. **Display and Navigation**
   - The system must integrate with Hugo Book theme structure
   - The system must provide search and filter capabilities
   - The system must support both list and detailed views
   - The system must display comparison tables for value analysis

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Will not** attempt to catalog every LLM model in existence
2. **Will not** host model files or weights
3. **Will not** provide model training or fine-tuning capabilities
4. **Will not** include benchmarking or performance testing
5. **Will not** create a model comparison tool (initially)

## Design Considerations

- **Integration**: Should work seamlessly within Hugo Book theme
- **Visibility**: Library can be hidden from main navigation, accessible only through table of contents
- **Performance**: Updates should happen via build process or scheduled jobs
- **Storage**: Model data stored as structured markdown or JSON files
- **Display**: Clean, scannable format with expandable details
- **Navigation**: Utilize Hugo Book's automatic TOC generation for library sections

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Options

1. **Static Generation with Auto-TOC** (Recommended)
   - Build-time script fetches latest model data
   - Generates Hugo content files with proper front matter
   - Hugo Book automatically adds new content to TOC based on folder structure
   - Library section can be marked as `bookHidden: true` to hide from main nav
   - Updates on each site build

2. **Client-Side Dynamic**
   - JavaScript fetches model data from APIs
   - Updates displayed in real-time
   - Requires API keys management

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Static base content with dynamic updates
   - Scheduled GitHub Actions to update data

### Hugo Book TOC Integration

Hugo Book automatically generates table of contents based on:
- **Folder structure**: New markdown files in designated folders auto-appear in TOC
- **Front matter weight**: Controls ordering (lower weight = higher position)
- **bookHidden parameter**: Hides from main navigation but keeps in TOC
- **_index.md files**: Define section properties and whether they appear

Example structure:
```
content/
└── library/
    ├── _index.md (bookHidden: true)
    ├── best-local/
    │   ├── _index.md
    │   └── [auto-generated model files]
    └── best-value/
        ├── _index.md
        └── [auto-generated model files]
```

### Data Sources
- Hugging Face API (https://huggingface.co/api)
- Models.dev registry
- OpenAI model listings
- Anthropic model documentation
- Custom curated lists

## Success Metrics

1. **Library contains exactly 16-24 models total** (2-3 per category, 8 categories)
2. **Auto-updates run successfully** without manual intervention
3. **Users can identify the best model for their needs** in under 10 seconds
4. **Information stays current** within 7 days of releases
5. **Clear #1 recommendation** per category with justification
6. **Cost comparisons** are accurate and updated weekly
7. **No decision paralysis** - users feel confident with limited, curated choices

## Open Questions

1. **Update Frequency**: Daily, weekly, or on-build updates?
2. **Curation Criteria**: What makes a model "significant" enough to include?
3. **API Selection**: Which APIs provide the best data? Hugging Face vs Models.dev?
4. **Categories**: How to organize models (by task, architecture, company)?
5. **Depth of Information**: Basic summaries or detailed technical specs?
6. **Version Tracking**: Track model versions and updates?
7. **Integration Method**: Separate section or integrated throughout content?

## Implementation Notes

This feature would add significant value to the StartAITools knowledge base by providing a constantly updated reference of LLM developments. The auto-update functionality ensures the information stays current without manual maintenance, while curation keeps the library focused on quality over quantity.

Consider starting with a simple implementation that fetches from Hugging Face's API during the build process, generating markdown files that integrate with the Hugo Book structure. This can be expanded later with additional sources and features.
