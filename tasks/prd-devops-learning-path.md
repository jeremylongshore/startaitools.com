# Product Requirements Document: 6-Month DevOps Learning Path

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the creation of a comprehensive 6-month DevOps learning path for the StartAITools site, based on the proven roadmap from Akhilesh Mishra (@livingdevops). The path provides a structured, no-nonsense approach to learning DevOps from zero to job-ready, with practical projects and daily practice requirements. Each month builds on previous knowledge, culminating in portfolio projects that demonstrate real-world skills.

## Goals

1. **Create a structured 6-month learning curriculum** from zero to job-ready DevOps engineer
2. **Provide daily practice schedules** with 2-hour daily commitment
3. **Include hands-on projects** that build portfolio-worthy experience
4. **Cover essential tools and technologies** used in real DevOps roles
5. **Generate hireable skills** with demonstrable GitHub portfolio

## User Stories

1. **As a beginner**, I want a clear path from zero knowledge to DevOps proficiency
2. **As a learner**, I want daily practice tasks that fit into a 2-hour schedule
3. **As a job seeker**, I want projects that demonstrate my skills to employers
4. **As Jeremy**, I want to provide structured learning content that helps people transition to DevOps

   - Multi-environment infrastructure with Terraform and GitHub Actions
   - Containerized microservices on Kubernetes with monitoring
   - Event-driven serverless pipeline with Python automation
   - GitOps workflow with ArgoCD and blue-green deployments

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Will not** cover every DevOps tool in existence
2. **Will not** include advanced topics beyond entry-level requirements
3. **Will not** provide certification exam preparation
4. **Will not** cover Windows-specific DevOps tools
5. **Will not** include paid tool tutorials

## Design Considerations

- **Structure**: Monthly modules with weekly sub-topics
- **Format**: Mix of written guides, diagrams, and hands-on labs
- **Progress Tracking**: Checklist for each topic
- **Time Management**: 2-hour daily schedule templates
- **Resources**: Links to free learning materials and documentation

## Technical Considerations

### Content Organization
```

├── month-1-foundations/
│   ├── week-1-linux/
│   ├── week-2-networking/
│   ├── week-3-shell-scripting/

└── month-6-projects/
```

### Learning Features
- Daily practice schedules
- Progress checklists
- Hands-on lab instructions
- Project templates and starter code
- Resource links and references

## Success Metrics

1. **Complete curriculum published** with all 6 months of content
2. **Daily practice guides** for each topic area
3. **5 portfolio projects** with full documentation
4. **GitHub repository templates** for each project
5. **Clear progression path** from basics to job-ready skills

## Open Questions

1. **Prerequisites**: Should we assume zero programming knowledge?
2. **Cloud Provider**: Focus only on AWS or include Azure/GCP basics?
3. **Certification**: Should we align with any certification objectives?
4. **Community**: Create a Discord/Slack for learners to collaborate?
5. **Updates**: How often should the curriculum be updated?
6. **Assessments**: Include quizzes or skill checks?
7. **Video Content**: Text-only or include video tutorials?

## Implementation Notes

This learning path represents a significant content creation effort but would provide immense value to aspiring DevOps engineers. The curriculum follows industry best practices and focuses on practical, hireable skills rather than theoretical knowledge.

The key differentiator is the emphasis on consistency (2 hours daily) and portfolio building through real projects that demonstrate competency to potential employers.
