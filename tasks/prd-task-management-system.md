# Product Requirements Document: Integrated Task Management System

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of a comprehensive task management system that tracks PRDs, ADRs, task lists, and progress with detailed comments and updates. The system would integrate with the existing AI Dev Tasks workflow to create a complete project management solution where AI agents are required to update task status, add comments, and maintain project history.

## Goals

1. **Centralize all project documentation** (PRDs, ADRs, tasks) in one system
2. **Track task progress automatically** with required status updates
3. **Maintain comment history** for every task completion
4. **Generate reports** on project status and completion rates
5. **Enforce accountability** through mandatory update requirements

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to see all my tasks, their status, and related documents in one place
2. **As an AI agent**, I must update task status and add comments when completing work
3. **As a project manager**, I want to track progress across multiple projects and PRDs
4. **As Jeremy**, I want a complete audit trail of what was done, when, and why

## Functional Requirements

### Core Task Management Features

1. **Task Hierarchy**
   - PRDs → Task Lists → Parent Tasks → Sub-tasks
   - ADRs linked to relevant tasks
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Priority levels and due dates

2. **Status Management**
   - States: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Review, Done, Blocked
   - Mandatory status updates with timestamps
   - Progress percentage calculations
   - Burndown charts

3. **Comment System**
   - Required completion comments
   - Implementation notes
   - Issue tracking
   - Code references and links

4. **AI Agent Integration**
   - Automatic task creation from PRDs
   - Required status updates via API/CLI
   - Comment templates for consistency
   - Validation before marking complete

## Tool Options Analysis

### 1. **Taskwarrior** (CLI-based)
```bash
# Example usage
task add project:hugo-migration "Install Hugo Book theme"
task 1 start
task 1 done comment:"Theme installed via git submodule"
```
**Pros**: CLI-native, scriptable, lightweight
**Cons**: No web UI, limited collaboration features

### 2. **Todo.txt** (Plain text)
```
(A) 2025-09-14 Install Hugo Book theme +hugo-migration @theme
x 2025-09-14 Theme installed via git submodule
```
**Pros**: Simple, version-controlled, portable
**Cons**: No advanced features, manual updates

### 3. **GitHub Issues/Projects**
**Pros**: Integrated with code, web UI, API access
**Cons**: Requires internet, not local-first

### 4. **Jira** (mentioned as "peta" - possibly meant Jira?)
**Pros**: Enterprise features, extensive integrations
**Cons**: Complex, expensive, overkill for personal use

### 5. **Custom Markdown-based System**
```markdown
## Task: Install Hugo Book theme
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Started**: 2025-09-14 10:00
- **Completed**: 2025-09-14 10:15
- **Comment**: Theme installed via git submodule
- **Changes**: Added themes/hugo-book, updated hugo.toml
```

## Recommended Implementation

### Hybrid Approach: Taskwarrior + Markdown + Git

1. **Taskwarrior for active management**
   ```bash
   # Create task from PRD
   task add project:prd-001 priority:H "Implement Hugo Book migration"

   # Update with progress
   task 1 modify progress:25 comment:"Theme installed"

   # Generate reports
   task project:prd-001 report
   ```

2. **Markdown for documentation**
   ```markdown
   tasks/
   ├── active/
   │   └── prd-001-hugo-migration.md
   ├── completed/
   │   └── [completed tasks with full history]
   └── reports/
       └── weekly-status.md
   ```

3. **Git for version control**
   - All updates committed
   - History preserved
   - Collaboration enabled

### Integration with AI Workflow

```python
# Example AI integration
def complete_task(task_id, comment):
    # Update Taskwarrior
    run_command(f"task {task_id} done")

    # Update markdown file
    update_task_file(task_id, "completed", comment)

    # Commit changes
    git_commit(f"Task {task_id} completed: {comment}")

    # Update parent PRD
    update_prd_progress(task_id)
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1: Basic Setup**
   - Install Taskwarrior
   - Create task templates
   - Set up directory structure
   - Create helper scripts

2. **Phase 2: AI Integration**
   - Modify AI Dev Tasks workflow
   - Add mandatory update hooks
   - Create validation functions
   - Implement progress tracking

3. **Phase 3: Reporting**
   - Daily status generation
   - Weekly summaries
   - Project dashboards
   - Completion metrics

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Will not** build custom web interface initially
2. **Will not** integrate with external PM tools
3. **Will not** support multi-user collaboration (single user focus)
4. **Will not** include time tracking initially
5. **Will not** implement billing/invoicing features

## Technical Considerations

### Data Schema
```yaml
task:
  id: unique_id
  prd_ref: prd-001
  title: "Task title"
  status: in_progress
  progress: 50
  created: timestamp
  updated: timestamp
  comments:
    - timestamp: time
      action: "status_change"
      message: "Started implementation"
  subtasks: []
```

### Required Claude Commands
```markdown
# .claude/commands/update-task.md
Update task status with required comment

# .claude/commands/task-report.md
Generate task status report

# .claude/commands/complete-task.md
Mark task complete with implementation details
```

## Success Metrics

1. **100% task update compliance** - All completed tasks have comments
2. **Complete audit trail** - Every change tracked and timestamped
3. **Automated reporting** - Daily/weekly status without manual work
4. **PRD tracking** - Progress visible for all active PRDs
5. **Historical data** - Can review any past project's timeline

## Open Questions

1. **Tool Choice**: Taskwarrior vs custom solution vs GitHub Issues?
2. **Update Frequency**: Real-time vs batch updates?
3. **Comment Detail**: How detailed should completion comments be?
4. **Integration Depth**: How tightly coupled with AI workflow?
5. **Reporting Format**: Markdown vs JSON vs HTML reports?
6. **Backup Strategy**: How to ensure data isn't lost?
7. **Migration Path**: How to import existing tasks?

## Implementation Notes

The key is creating a system that:
- Forces accountability through required updates
- Maintains complete history
- Integrates seamlessly with AI workflows
- Provides clear visibility into progress
- Doesn't add excessive overhead

Starting with Taskwarrior + Markdown provides a good balance of features and simplicity, with the option to build more sophisticated integrations over time.
