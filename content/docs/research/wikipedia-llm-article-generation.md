## Abstract

This paper studies how to apply large language models to write grounded and organized long-form articles from scratch, with comparable breadth and depth to Wikipedia pages.

## Key Topics

- Long-form content generation with LLMs
- Factual grounding and verification
- Wikipedia-style article structure
- Automated encyclopedic writing

## Subject Categories

- Computation and Language (cs.CL)
- Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
