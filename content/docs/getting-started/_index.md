2. Explore our [Glossary](/glossary/) for term definitions
3. Follow the [AI Development Workflow](/docs/workflow/ai-development-workflow/)

### I Want to Organize My Workspace
Transform your chaotic filesystem:
1. Read [Developer Workspace Organization](/docs/architecture/developer-workspace-organization/)
2. Download our cleanup scripts (coming soon)
3. Implement the three-pillar system

### I Want to Build AI Applications
Jump into practical development:
1. Review our [Project Journey](/docs/journey/) for inspiration
2. Use our [Documentation Templates](/docs/resources/)
3. Learn from our [Architecture Patterns](/docs/architecture/)

### 3. Start Building
Tell your AI assistant:
```
Use @ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md to create a PRD for my feature
```
