## Creating Industries That Don't Exist

Intent Solutions ships AI automation, RAG agents, and production-ready products for operators who need real outcomes—faster onboarding, fewer spreadsheets, and launch-ready customer experiences.

We build systems that ship to production, not proof-of-concepts that sit in slides.

---

## What We Build

### Automation Programs
Design and implement n8n, Netlify Functions, and Vertex AI workflows that replace manual reporting and onboarding tasks. Measurable elimination of repetitive work.

### AI Agents & RAG Systems
Deploy Claude- and OpenAI-powered agents backed by your docs, vector stores, and safety rails so teams trust every recommendation. Grounded in your actual data.

### Data & Infrastructure Foundations
Architect BigQuery, Firebase, and Postgres pipelines with telemetry, access control, and monitoring baked in from day one. Production-grade from the start.

### Launch-Ready Product Builds
Ship Astro + React experiences, surveys, and admin tools with coherent design systems, copy, and analytics instrumentation included. Ready for customers.
