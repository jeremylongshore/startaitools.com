# Run sample

This sample launches an MCP Server with middleware that verifies the presence of a valid Authorization header.

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]" 
```

## Start server

```bash
python server.py
```

Launch the client in a separate terminal

```bash
python client.py
```

You should see a result similar to:

```text
2025-09-30 13:25:54 - mcp_client - INFO - Tool result: meta=None content=[TextContent(type='text', text='{\n  "current_time": "2025-09-30T13:25:54.311900",\n  "timezone": "UTC",\n  "timestamp": 1759238754.3119,\n  "formatted": "2025-09-30 13:25:54"\n}', annotations=None, meta=None)] structuredContent={'current_time': '2025-09-30T13:25:54.311900', 'timezone': 'UTC', 'timestamp': 1759238754.3119, 'formatted': '2025-09-30 13:25:54'} isError=False
```

This indicates that the credential being sent is accepted.

Try modifying the credential in `client.py` to "secret-token2", and you should see this text as part of the response:

```text
2025-09-30 13:27:44 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8000/mcp "HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden"
```

This indicates that you were authenticated (you provided a credential), but it was invalid.
