# Running this sample

## -1- Install the dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## -2- Run the sample

```bash
dotnet run
```

## -3- Test the sample

Start a separate terminal before running the commands below (ensure the server is still active).

With the server running in one terminal, open another terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://localhost:3001
```

This will start a web server with a visual interface that allows you to test the sample.

> Ensure that **Streamable HTTP** is selected as the transport type, and the URL is `http://localhost:3001/mcp`.

Once the server is connected:

- Try listing tools and run `add` with arguments 2 and 4. You should see 6 as the result.
- Navigate to resources and resource templates, call "greeting," type in a name, and you should see a greeting with the name you provided.

### Testing in CLI mode

You can directly launch it in CLI mode by running the following command:

```bash 
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://localhost:3001 --method tools/list
```

This will list all the tools available on the server. You should see the following output:

```text
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "AddNumbers",
      "description": "Add two numbers together.",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "a": {
            "description": "The first number",
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "b": {
            "description": "The second number",
            "type": "integer"
          }
        },
        "title": "AddNumbers",
        "description": "Add two numbers together.",
        "required": [
          "a",
          "b"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To invoke a tool, type:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://localhost:3001 --method tools/call --tool-name AddNumbers --tool-arg a=1 --tool-arg b=2
```

You should see the following output:

```text
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "3"
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Running the inspector in CLI mode is usually much faster than using the browser.
