# Run this sample

> [!NOTE]
> This sample assumes you're using a GitHub Codespaces instance. If you want to run this locally, you need to set up a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub.
>
> ```bash
> # zsh/bash
> export GITHUB_TOKEN="{{YOUR_GITHUB_PAT}}"
> ```
>
> ```powershell
> # PowerShell
> $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "{{YOUR_GITHUB_PAT}}"
> ```

## Install libraries

```sh
dotnet restore
```

This should install the following libraries: Azure AI Inference, Azure Identity, Microsoft.Extension, Model.Hosting, ModelContextProtocol

## Run

```sh 
dotnet run
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
Setting up stdio transport
Listing tools
Connected to server with tools: Add
Tool description: Adds two numbers
Tool parameters: {"title":"Add","description":"Adds two numbers","type":"object","properties":{"a":{"type":"integer"},"b":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["a","b"]}
Tool definition: Azure.AI.Inference.ChatCompletionsToolDefinition
Properties: {"a":{"type":"integer"},"b":{"type":"integer"}}
MCP Tools def: 0: Azure.AI.Inference.ChatCompletionsToolDefinition
Tool call 0: Add with arguments {"a":2,"b":4}
Sum 6
```

Much of the output is just debugging, but the important part is that you are listing tools from the MCP Server, converting those into LLM tools, and you end up with an MCP client response "Sum 6".
