# Running this sample

## -1- Install the dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## -3- Run the sample

```bash
dotnet run
```

## -4- Test the sample

With the server running in one terminal, open another terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run
```

This will start a web server with a visual interface that lets you test the sample.

Once the server is connected:

- Try listing tools and run `add` with arguments 2 and 4. You should see 6 as the result.
- Go to resources and resource template, call "greeting," type in a name, and you should see a greeting with the name you entered.

### Testing in CLI mode

You can also launch it directly in CLI mode by running the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli dotnet run --method tools/list
```

This will display all the tools available on the server. You should see the following output:

```text
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "Add",
      "description": "Adds two numbers",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "a": {
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "b": {
            "type": "integer"
          }
        },
        "title": "Add",
        "description": "Adds two numbers",
        "required": [
          "a",
          "b"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To use a tool, type:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli dotnet run --method tools/call --tool-name Add --tool-arg a=1 --tool-arg b=2
```

You should see the following output:

```text
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Sum 3"
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Running the inspector in CLI mode is usually much faster than using the browser.
