# Running this sample

It is recommended to install `uv`, but it's not mandatory. See [instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#highlights).

## -1- Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## -3- Run the sample

```bash
npm run build
```

## -4- Test the sample

With the server running in one terminal, open another terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

This will start a web server with a visual interface that allows you to test the sample.

Once the server is connected:

- Try listing tools and run `add` with arguments 2 and 4. You should see 6 as the result.
- Navigate to resources and resource templates, then call "greeting." Enter a name, and you should see a greeting with the name you provided.

### Testing in CLI mode

The inspector you launched is actually a Node.js application, and `mcp dev` is a wrapper around it.

You can start it directly in CLI mode by running the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node ./build/index.js --method tools/list
```

This will list all the tools available on the server. You should see the following output:

```text
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "add",
      "description": "Add two numbers",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "a": {
            "title": "A",
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "b": {
            "title": "B",
            "type": "integer"
          }
        },
        "required": [
          "a",
          "b"
        ],
        "title": "addArguments"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To invoke a tool, type:

```bash
nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node ./build/index.js --method tools/call --tool-name add --tool-arg a=1 --tool-arg b=2
```

You should see the following output:

```text
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "3"
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Running the inspector in CLI mode is usually much faster than using the browser.
