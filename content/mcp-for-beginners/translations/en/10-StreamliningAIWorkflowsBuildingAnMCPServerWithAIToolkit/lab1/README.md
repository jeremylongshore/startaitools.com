## 🧪 Hands-on Exercise 1: Exploring GitHub Models

**🎯 Objective**: Get familiar with the Model Catalog and test your first AI model

### 📊 Step 1: Navigate the Model Catalog

The Model Catalog is your gateway to the AI ecosystem. It aggregates models from multiple providers, making it easy to discover and compare options.

**🔍 Navigation Guide:**

Click on **MODELS - Catalog** in the AI Toolkit sidebar

![Model Catalog](../../../../translated_images/aimodel.263ed2be013d8fb0e2265c4f742cfe490f6f00eca5e132ec50438c8e826e34ed.en.png)

**💡 Pro Tip**: Look for models with specific features that fit your needs (e.g., code generation, creative writing, analysis).

**⚠️ Note**: GitHub-hosted models (GitHub Models) are free to use but have rate limits on requests and tokens. To access non-GitHub models (external models hosted via Azure AI or other endpoints), you’ll need to provide the appropriate API key or authentication.

### 🚀 Step 2: Add and Configure Your First Model

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- **GPT-4.1**: Best for complex reasoning and analysis
- **Phi-4-mini**: Lightweight, fast responses for simple tasks

**🔧 Configuration Process:**
1. Select **OpenAI GPT-4.1** from the catalog
2. Click **Add to My Models** to register the model for use
3. Choose **Try in Playground** to open the testing environment
4. Wait for the model to initialize (first-time setup may take a moment)

![Playground Setup](../../../../translated_images/playground.dd6f5141344878ca4d4f3de819775da7b113518941accf37c291117c602f85db.en.png)

**⚙️ Understanding Model Parameters:**
- **Temperature**: Controls creativity (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum length of the response
- **Top-p**: Nucleus sampling to control response diversity

### 🎯 Step 3: Master the Playground Interface

The Playground is your AI experimentation lab. Here’s how to get the most out of it:

**🎨 Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**
1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed instructions get better results
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Use Examples**: Show the model what you want with examples
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on initial outputs

**🧪 Testing Scenarios:**
```markdown
# Example 1: Code Generation
"Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. Include error handling and docstrings."

# Example 2: Creative Writing
"Write a professional email to a client explaining a project delay, maintaining a positive tone while being transparent about challenges."

# Example 3: Data Analysis
"Analyze this sales data and provide insights: [paste your data]. Focus on trends, anomalies, and actionable recommendations."
```

### 🏆 Challenge Exercise: Model Performance Comparison

**🎯 Goal**: Compare different models using the same prompts to understand their strengths

**📋 Instructions:**
1. Add **Phi-4-mini** to your workspace
2. Use the same prompt for both GPT-4.1 and Phi-4-mini

![set](../../../../translated_images/set.88132df189ecde2cbbda256c1841db5aac8e9bdeba1a4e343dfa031b9545d6c9.en.png)

3. Compare response quality, speed, and accuracy
4. Document your findings in the results section

**💡 Key Insights to Discover:**
- When to use LLM vs SLM
- Cost vs. performance trade-offs
- Specialized strengths of different models

## 🤖 Hands-on Exercise 2: Building Custom Agents with Agent Builder

**🎯 Objective**: Create specialized AI agents tailored to specific tasks and workflows

### 🏗️ Step 1: Understanding Agent Builder

Agent Builder is where AI Toolkit really shines. It lets you create purpose-built AI assistants that combine large language models with custom instructions, specific parameters, and specialized knowledge.

**🧠 Agent Architecture Components:**
- **Core Model**: The base LLM (GPT-4, Groks, Phi, etc.)
- **System Prompt**: Defines the agent’s personality and behavior
- **Parameters**: Fine-tuned settings for best performance
- **Tools Integration**: Connect to external APIs and MCP services
- **Memory**: Conversation context and session persistence

![Agent Builder Interface](../../../../translated_images/agentbuilder.25895b2d2f8c02e7aa99dd40e105877a6f1db8f0441180087e39db67744b361f.en.png)

### ⚙️ Step 2: Agent Configuration Deep Dive

**🎨 Creating Effective System Prompts:**
```markdown
# Template Structure:
## Role Definition
You are a [specific role] with expertise in [domain].

## Capabilities
