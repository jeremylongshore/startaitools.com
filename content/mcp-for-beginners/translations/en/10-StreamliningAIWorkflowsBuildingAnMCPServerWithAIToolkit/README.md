# Streamlining AI Workflows: Building an MCP Server with AI Toolkit

## 🎯 Overview

_(Click the image above to view video of this lesson)_

Welcome to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Workshop**! This hands-on workshop combines two innovative technologies to transform the way AI applications are developed:

- **🔗 Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard for seamless integration between AI tools
- **🛠️ AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (AITK)**: Microsoft's powerful extension for AI development

### 🎓 What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be equipped to create intelligent applications that connect AI models with real-world tools and services. From automated testing to custom API integrations, you'll gain practical skills to tackle complex business challenges.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

### 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is the **"USB-C for AI"** - a universal standard that links AI models to external tools and data sources.

**✨ Key Features:**

- 🔄 **Standardized Integration**: A universal interface for connecting AI tools
- 🏛️ **Flexible Architecture**: Supports local and remote servers via stdio/SSE transport
- 🧰 **Rich Ecosystem**: Combines tools, prompts, and resources in one protocol
- 🔒 **Enterprise-Ready**: Built-in security and reliability

**🎯 Why MCP Matters:**
Just as USB-C simplified cable connections, MCP simplifies AI integrations. One protocol, endless possibilities.

### 🤖 AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (AITK)

Microsoft's flagship extension for AI development, turning VS Code into a powerful AI development environment.

**🚀 Core Capabilities:**

- 📦 **Model Catalog**: Access models from Azure AI, GitHub, Hugging Face, Ollama
- ⚡ **Local Inference**: Optimized execution on CPU/GPU/NPU using ONNX
- 🏗️ **Agent Builder**: Visual development of AI agents with MCP integration
- 🎭 **Multi-Modal**: Supports text, vision, and structured output

**💡 Development Benefits:**

- Zero-configuration model deployment
- Visual prompt engineering
- Real-time testing playground
- Seamless integration with MCP servers
