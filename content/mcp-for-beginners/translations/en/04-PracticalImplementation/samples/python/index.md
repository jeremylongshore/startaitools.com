# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), showing how to build both a server and client application that communicate using the MCP standard.

## Overview

The MCP implementation includes two main parts:

1. **MCP Server (`server.py`)** - A server that provides:
   - **Tools**: Functions that can be called remotely
   - **Resources**: Data that can be accessed
   - **Prompts**: Templates for generating prompts for language models

2. **MCP Client (`client.py`)** - A client application that connects to the server and uses its features

## Features

This implementation showcases several key MCP features:

### Tools
- `completion` - Generates text completions from AI models (simulated)
- `add` - Simple calculator that adds two numbers

### Resources
- `models://` - Returns information about available AI models
- `greeting://{name}` - Returns a personalized greeting for a given name

### Prompts
- `review_code` - Generates a prompt for reviewing code

## Installation

To use this MCP implementation, install the required packages:

```powershell
pip install mcp-server mcp-client
```

## Running the Server and Client

### Starting the Server

Run the server in one terminal window:

```powershell
python server.py
```

The server can also be run in development mode using the MCP CLI:

```powershell
mcp dev server.py
```

Or installed in Claude Desktop (if available):

```powershell
mcp install server.py
```

### Running the Client

Run the client in another terminal window:

```powershell
python client.py
```

This will connect to the server and demonstrate all available features.

### Client Usage

The client (`client.py`) demonstrates all the MCP capabilities:

```powershell
python client.py
```

This will connect to the server and test all features including tools, resources, and prompts. The output will show:

1. Calculator tool result (5 + 7 = 12)
2. Completion tool response to "What is the meaning of life?"
3. List of available AI models
4. Personalized greeting for "MCP Explorer"
5. Code review prompt template

## Implementation Details

The server is built using the `FastMCP` API, which offers high-level abstractions for defining MCP services. Here's a simplified example of how tools are defined:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together
    
    Args:
        a: First number
        b: Second number
    
    Returns:
        The sum of the two numbers
    """
    logger.info(f"Adding {a} and {b}")
    return a + b
```

The client uses the MCP client library to connect to and call the server:

```python
async with stdio_client(server_params) as (reader, writer):
    async with ClientSession(reader, writer) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        result = await session.call_tool("add", arguments={"a": 5, "b": 7})
```
