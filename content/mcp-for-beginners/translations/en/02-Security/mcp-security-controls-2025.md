# MCP Security Controls - August 2025 Update

> **Current Standard**: This document reflects [MCP Specification 2025-06-18](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/) security requirements and official [MCP Security Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices).

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has significantly advanced with improved security controls addressing both traditional software vulnerabilities and AI-specific threats. This document outlines comprehensive security measures for secure MCP implementations as of August 2025.

## **MANDATORY Security Requirements**

### **Critical Prohibitions from MCP Specification:**

> **FORBIDDEN**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server  
>
> **PROHIBITED**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** use sessions for authentication  
>
> **REQUIRED**: MCP servers implementing authorization **MUST** verify ALL inbound requests  
>
> **MANDATORY**: MCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically registered client  

---

## 1. **Authentication & Authorization Controls**

### **External Identity Provider Integration**

**Current MCP Standard (2025-06-18)** allows MCP servers to delegate authentication to external identity providers, representing a significant security improvement:

**Security Benefits:**
1. **Eliminates Custom Authentication Risks**: Reduces vulnerabilities by avoiding custom authentication implementations  
2. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Leverages established identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID with advanced security features  
3. **Centralized Identity Management**: Simplifies user lifecycle management, access control, and compliance auditing  
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Inherits MFA capabilities from enterprise identity providers  
5. **Conditional Access Policies**: Benefits from risk-based access controls and adaptive authentication  

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Token Audience Validation**: Ensure all tokens are explicitly issued for the MCP server  
- **Issuer Verification**: Confirm the token issuer matches the expected identity provider  
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographically validate token integrity  
- **Expiration Enforcement**: Strictly enforce token lifetime limits  
- **Scope Validation**: Verify tokens contain appropriate permissions for requested operations  

### **Authorization Logic Security**

**Critical Controls:**
- **Comprehensive Authorization Audits**: Regularly review all authorization decision points for security  
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Deny access when authorization logic cannot make a definitive decision  
- **Permission Boundaries**: Clearly separate different privilege levels and resource access  
- **Audit Logging**: Log all authorization decisions for security monitoring  
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically validate user permissions and privilege assignments  

## 2. **Token Security & Anti-Passthrough Controls**

### **Token Passthrough Prevention**

**Token passthrough is explicitly prohibited** in the MCP Authorization Specification due to critical security risks:

**Security Risks Addressed:**
- **Control Circumvention**: Bypasses essential security controls like rate limiting, request validation, and traffic monitoring  
- **Accountability Breakdown**: Prevents client identification, corrupting audit trails and incident investigations  
- **Proxy-Based Exfiltration**: Allows malicious actors to use servers as proxies for unauthorized data access  
- **Trust Boundary Violations**: Breaks downstream service trust assumptions about token origins  
- **Lateral Movement**: Enables broader attack expansion with compromised tokens across multiple services  

**Implementation Controls:**
```yaml
Token Validation Requirements:
  audience_validation: MANDATORY
  issuer_verification: MANDATORY  
  signature_check: MANDATORY
  expiration_enforcement: MANDATORY
  scope_validation: MANDATORY
  
Token Lifecycle Management:
  rotation_frequency: "Short-lived tokens preferred"
  secure_storage: "Azure Key Vault or equivalent"
  transmission_security: "TLS 1.3 minimum"
  replay_protection: "Implemented via nonce/timestamp"
```

### **Secure Token Management Patterns**

**Best Practices:**
- **Short-Lived Tokens**: Reduce exposure by frequently rotating tokens  
- **Just-in-Time Issuance**: Issue tokens only when needed for specific operations  
- **Secure Storage**: Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults  
- **Token Binding**: Bind tokens to specific clients, sessions, or operations where possible  
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Detect token misuse or unauthorized access patterns in real time  

## 3. **Session Security Controls**

### **Session Hijacking Prevention**

**Attack Vectors Addressed:**
- **Session Hijack Prompt Injection**: Malicious events injected into shared session state  
- **Session Impersonation**: Unauthorized use of stolen session IDs to bypass authentication  
- **Resumable Stream Attacks**: Exploitation of server-sent event resumption for malicious content injection  

**Mandatory Session Controls:**
```yaml
Session ID Generation:
  randomness_source: "Cryptographically secure RNG"
  entropy_bits: 128 # Minimum recommended
  format: "Base64url encoded"
  predictability: "MUST be non-deterministic"

Session Binding:
  user_binding: "REQUIRED - <user_id>:<session_id>"
  additional_identifiers: "Device fingerprint, IP validation"
  context_binding: "Request origin, user agent validation"
  
Session Lifecycle:
  expiration: "Configurable timeout policies"
  rotation: "After privilege escalation events"
  invalidation: "Immediate on security events"
  cleanup: "Automated expired session removal"
```

**Transport Security:**
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All session communication must use TLS 1.3  
- **Secure Cookie Attributes**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict  
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevent MITM attacks for critical connections  

### **Stateful vs Stateless Considerations**

**For Stateful Implementations:**
- Shared session state requires additional protection against injection attacks  
- Queue-based session management needs integrity verification  
- Multiple server instances require secure session state synchronization  

**For Stateless Implementations:**
- Use JWT or similar token-based session management  
- Cryptographically verify session state integrity  
- Reduced attack surface but requires robust token validation  

## 4. **AI-Specific Security Controls**

- **Rollback Capabilities**: Allow reversion to previous tool versions  
- **Change Auditing**: Maintain a complete history of tool definition modifications  
- **Risk Assessment**: Automate evaluation of tool security posture

```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **User Consent Verification**: Always require consent screens for dynamic client registration  
- **Redirect URI Validation**: Strictly validate redirect destinations using a whitelist  
- **Authorization Code Protection**: Use short-lived codes with single-use enforcement  
- **Client Identity Verification**: Robustly validate client credentials and metadata
