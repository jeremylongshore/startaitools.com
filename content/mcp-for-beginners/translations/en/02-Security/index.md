Security is a cornerstone of AI system design, which is why we emphasize it as our second section. This aligns with Microsoft's **Secure by Design** principle from the [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2025/04/17/microsofts-secure-by-design-journey-one-year-of-success/).

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces powerful capabilities for AI-driven applications but also brings unique security challenges that go beyond traditional software risks. MCP systems face both established security concerns (secure coding, least privilege, supply chain security) and new AI-specific threats such as prompt injection, tool poisoning, session hijacking, confused deputy attacks, token passthrough vulnerabilities, and dynamic capability modification.

This lesson delves into the most critical security risks in MCP implementations—covering authentication, authorization, excessive permissions, indirect prompt injection, session security, confused deputy problems, token management, and supply chain vulnerabilities. You'll learn actionable controls and best practices to mitigate these risks while leveraging Microsoft solutions like Prompt Shields, Azure Content Safety, and GitHub Advanced Security to enhance your MCP deployment.

# MCP Security Architecture & Controls

Modern MCP implementations require layered security approaches that address both traditional software security and AI-specific threats. The rapidly evolving MCP specification continues to mature its security controls, enabling better integration with enterprise security architectures and established best practices.

Research from the [Microsoft Digital Defense Report](https://aka.ms/mddr) shows that **98% of reported breaches could be prevented by robust security hygiene**. The most effective protection strategy combines foundational security practices with MCP-specific controls—proven baseline security measures remain the most impactful in reducing overall security risk.

## Current Security Landscape

> **Note:** This information reflects MCP security standards as of **August 18, 2025**. The MCP protocol continues to evolve rapidly, and future implementations may introduce new authentication patterns and enhanced controls. Always refer to the current [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/), [MCP GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol), and [security best practices documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices) for the latest guidance.

### Evolution of MCP Authentication

The MCP specification has evolved significantly in its approach to authentication and authorization:

- **Original Approach**: Early specifications required developers to implement custom authentication servers, with MCP servers acting as OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers managing user authentication directly.
- **Current Standard (2025-06-18)**: The updated specification allows MCP servers to delegate authentication to external identity providers (such as Microsoft Entra ID), improving security posture and reducing implementation complexity.
- **Transport Layer Security**: Enhanced support for secure transport mechanisms with proper authentication patterns for both local (STDIO) and remote (Streamable HTTP) connections.

## Authentication & Authorization Security

### Current Security Challenges

Modern MCP implementations face several authentication and authorization challenges:

### Risks & Threat Vectors

- **Misconfigured Authorization Logic**: Flawed authorization implementation in MCP servers can expose sensitive data and incorrectly apply access controls.
- **OAuth Token Compromise**: Local MCP server token theft enables attackers to impersonate servers and access downstream services.
- **Token Passthrough Vulnerabilities**: Improper token handling creates security control bypasses and accountability gaps.
- **Excessive Permissions**: Over-privileged MCP servers violate least privilege principles and expand attack surfaces.

#### Token Passthrough: A Critical Anti-Pattern

**Token passthrough is explicitly prohibited** in the current MCP authorization specification due to severe security implications:

##### Security Control Circumvention
- MCP servers and downstream APIs implement critical security controls (rate limiting, request validation, traffic monitoring) that depend on proper token validation.
- Direct client-to-API token usage bypasses these essential protections, undermining the security architecture.

##### Accountability & Audit Challenges  
- MCP servers cannot distinguish between clients using upstream-issued tokens, breaking audit trails.
- Downstream resource server logs show misleading request origins rather than actual MCP server intermediaries.
- Incident investigation and compliance auditing become significantly more difficult.

##### Data Exfiltration Risks
- Unvalidated token claims enable malicious actors with stolen tokens to use MCP servers as proxies for data exfiltration.
- Trust boundary violations allow unauthorized access patterns that bypass intended security controls.

##### Multi-Service Attack Vectors
- Compromised tokens accepted by multiple services enable lateral movement across connected systems.
- Trust assumptions between services may be violated when token origins cannot be verified.

### Security Controls & Mitigations

**Critical Security Requirements:**

> **MANDATORY**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server.

#### Authentication & Authorization Controls

- **Rigorous Authorization Review**: Conduct comprehensive audits of MCP server authorization logic to ensure only intended users and clients can access sensitive resources.
  - **Implementation Guide**: [Azure API Management as Authentication Gateway for MCP Servers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/azure-api-management-your-auth-gateway-for-mcp-servers/4402690)
  - **Identity Integration**: [Using Microsoft Entra ID for MCP Server Authentication](https://den.dev/blog/mcp-server-auth-entra-id-session/)

- **Secure Token Management**: Implement [Microsoft's token validation and lifecycle best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens).
  - Validate token audience claims match MCP server identity.
  - Implement proper token rotation and expiration policies.
  - Prevent token replay attacks and unauthorized usage.

- **Protected Token Storage**: Secure token storage with encryption both at rest and in transit.
  - **Best Practices**: [Secure Token Storage and Encryption Guidelines](https://youtu.be/uRdX37EcCwg?si=6fSChs1G4glwXRy2)

#### Access Control Implementation

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant MCP servers only the minimum permissions required for intended functionality.
  - Regular permission reviews and updates to prevent privilege creep.
  - **Microsoft Documentation**: [Secure Least-Privileged Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/secure-least-privileged-access)

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement fine-grained role assignments.
  - Scope roles tightly to specific resources and actions.
  - Avoid broad or unnecessary permissions that expand attack surfaces.

- **Continuous Permission Monitoring**: Implement ongoing access auditing and monitoring.
  - Monitor permission usage patterns for anomalies.
  - Promptly remediate excessive or unused privileges.

## AI-Specific Security Threats

### Prompt Injection & Tool Manipulation Attacks

Modern MCP implementations face sophisticated AI-specific attack vectors that traditional security measures cannot fully address:

#### **Indirect Prompt Injection (Cross-Domain Prompt Injection)**

**Indirect Prompt Injection** represents one of the most critical vulnerabilities in MCP-enabled AI systems. Attackers embed malicious instructions within external content—documents, web pages, emails, or data sources—that AI systems subsequently process as legitimate commands.

**Attack Scenarios:**
- **Document-based Injection**: Malicious instructions hidden in processed documents that trigger unintended AI actions.
- **Web Content Exploitation**: Compromised web pages containing embedded prompts that manipulate AI behavior when scraped.
- **Email-based Attacks**: Malicious prompts in emails that cause AI assistants to leak information or perform unauthorized actions.
- **Data Source Contamination**: Compromised databases or APIs serving tainted content to AI systems.

**Real-World Impact**: These attacks can result in data exfiltration, privacy breaches, generation of harmful content, and manipulation of user interactions. For detailed analysis, see [Prompt Injection in MCP (Simon Willison)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/9/mcp-prompt-injection/).

![Prompt Injection Attack Diagram](../../../translated_images/prompt-injection.ed9fbfde297ca877c15bc6daa808681cd3c3dc7bf27bbbda342ef1ba5fc4f52d.en.png)

#### **Tool Poisoning Attacks**

**Tool Poisoning** targets the metadata that defines MCP tools, exploiting how LLMs interpret tool descriptions and parameters to make execution decisions.

**Attack Mechanisms:**
- **Metadata Manipulation**: Attackers inject malicious instructions into tool descriptions, parameter definitions, or usage examples.
- **Invisible Instructions**: Hidden prompts in tool metadata that are processed by AI models but invisible to human users.
- **Dynamic Tool Modification ("Rug Pulls")**: Tools approved by users are later modified to perform malicious actions without user awareness.
- **Parameter Injection**: Malicious content embedded in tool parameter schemas that influence model behavior.

**Hosted Server Risks**: Remote MCP servers present elevated risks as tool definitions can be updated after initial user approval, creating scenarios where previously safe tools become malicious. For comprehensive analysis, see [Tool Poisoning Attacks (Invariant Labs)](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks).

![Tool Injection Attack Diagram](../../../translated_images/tool-injection.3b0b4a6b24de6befe7d3afdeae44138ef005881aebcfc84c6f61369ce31e3640.en.png)

#### **Additional AI Attack Vectors**

- **Cross-Domain Prompt Injection (XPIA)**: Sophisticated attacks that leverage content from multiple domains to bypass security controls.
- **Dynamic Capability Modification**: Real-time changes to tool capabilities that escape initial security assessments.
- **Context Window Poisoning**: Attacks that manipulate large context windows to hide malicious instructions.
- **Model Confusion Attacks**: Exploiting model limitations to create unpredictable or unsafe behaviors.

### AI Security Risk Impact

**High-Impact Consequences:**
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access and theft of sensitive enterprise or personal data.
- **Privacy Breaches**: Exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential business data.  
- **System Manipulation**: Unintended modifications to critical systems and workflows.
- **Credential Theft**: Compromise of authentication tokens and service credentials.
- **Lateral Movement**: Use of compromised AI systems as pivots for broader network attacks.

## Advanced MCP Security Threats

### Session Hijacking Vulnerabilities

**Session hijacking** represents a critical attack vector in stateful MCP implementations where unauthorized parties obtain and abuse legitimate session identifiers to impersonate clients and perform unauthorized actions.

#### **Attack Scenarios & Risks**

- **Session Hijack Prompt Injection**: Attackers with stolen session IDs inject malicious events into servers sharing session state, potentially triggering harmful actions or accessing sensitive data.
- **Direct Impersonation**: Stolen session IDs enable direct MCP server calls that bypass authentication, treating attackers as legitimate users.
- **Compromised Resumable Streams**: Attackers can terminate requests prematurely, causing legitimate clients to resume with potentially malicious content.

#### **Security Controls for Session Management**

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Authorization Verification**: MCP servers implementing authorization **MUST** verify ALL inbound requests and **MUST NOT** rely on sessions for authentication.
- **Secure Session Generation**: Use cryptographically secure, non-deterministic session IDs generated with secure random number generators  
- **User-Specific Binding**: Bind session IDs to user-specific information using formats like `<user_id>:<session_id>` to prevent cross-user session abuse  
- **Session Lifecycle Management**: Implement proper expiration, rotation, and invalidation to limit vulnerability windows  
- **Transport Security**: Mandatory HTTPS for all communication to prevent session ID interception  

### Confused Deputy Problem  

The **confused deputy problem** occurs when MCP servers act as authentication proxies between clients and third-party services, creating opportunities for authorization bypass through static client ID exploitation.  

#### **Attack Mechanics & Risks**  

- **Cookie-based Consent Bypass**: Previous user authentication creates consent cookies that attackers exploit through malicious authorization requests with crafted redirect URIs  
- **Authorization Code Theft**: Existing consent cookies may cause authorization servers to skip consent screens, redirecting codes to attacker-controlled endpoints  
- **Unauthorized API Access**: Stolen authorization codes enable token exchange and user impersonation without explicit approval  

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  

**Mandatory Controls:**  
- **Explicit Consent Requirements**: MCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically registered client  
- **OAuth 2.1 Security Implementation**: Follow current OAuth security best practices including PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for all authorization requests  
- **Strict Client Validation**: Implement rigorous validation of redirect URIs and client identifiers to prevent exploitation  

### Token Passthrough Vulnerabilities  

**Token passthrough** represents an explicit anti-pattern where MCP servers accept client tokens without proper validation and forward them to downstream APIs, violating MCP authorization specifications.  

#### **Security Implications**  

- **Control Circumvention**: Direct client-to-API token usage bypasses critical rate limiting, validation, and monitoring controls  
- **Audit Trail Corruption**: Upstream-issued tokens make client identification impossible, breaking incident investigation capabilities  
- **Proxy-based Data Exfiltration**: Unvalidated tokens enable malicious actors to use servers as proxies for unauthorized data access  
- **Trust Boundary Violations**: Downstream services' trust assumptions may be violated when token origins cannot be verified  
- **Multi-service Attack Expansion**: Compromised tokens accepted across multiple services enable lateral movement  

#### **Required Security Controls**  

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**  
- **Token Validation**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept tokens not explicitly issued for the MCP server  
- **Audience Verification**: Always validate token audience claims match the MCP server's identity  
- **Proper Token Lifecycle**: Implement short-lived access tokens with secure rotation practices  

## Supply Chain Security for AI Systems
