# MCP Security Best Practices - August 2025 Update

> **Important**: This document reflects the latest [MCP Specification 2025-06-18](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/) security requirements and official [MCP Security Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices). Always refer to the current specification for the most up-to-date guidance.

## Essential Security Practices for MCP Implementations

The Model Context Protocol introduces unique security challenges that go beyond traditional software security. These practices address both foundational security requirements and MCP-specific threats, including prompt injection, tool poisoning, session hijacking, confused deputy problems, and token passthrough vulnerabilities.

### **MANDATORY Security Requirements**

**Critical Requirements from MCP Specification:**

> **MUST NOT**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server  
> **MUST**: MCP servers implementing authorization **MUST** verify ALL inbound requests  
> **MUST NOT**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** use sessions for authentication  
> **MUST**: MCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically registered client  

---

## 1. **Token Security & Authentication**

**Authentication & Authorization Controls:**  
   - **Rigorous Authorization Review**: Conduct thorough audits of MCP server authorization logic to ensure only intended users and clients can access resources  
   - **External Identity Provider Integration**: Use established identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID instead of custom authentication solutions  
   - **Token Audience Validation**: Always confirm that tokens were explicitly issued for your MCP serverâ€”never accept upstream tokens  
   - **Proper Token Lifecycle**: Implement secure token rotation, expiration policies, and measures to prevent token replay attacks  

**Protected Token Storage:**  
   - Use Azure Key Vault or similar secure credential stores for all secrets  
   - Encrypt tokens both at rest and in transit  
   - Regularly rotate credentials and monitor for unauthorized access  

## 2. **Session Management & Transport Security**

**Secure Session Practices:**  
   - **Cryptographically Secure Session IDs**: Generate secure, non-deterministic session IDs using secure random number generators  
   - **User-Specific Binding**: Bind session IDs to user identities using formats like `<user_id>:<session_id>` to prevent cross-user session abuse  
   - **Session Lifecycle Management**: Implement proper expiration, rotation, and invalidation to limit vulnerability windows  
   - **HTTPS/TLS Enforcement**: Require HTTPS for all communication to prevent session ID interception  

**Transport Layer Security:**  
   - Configure TLS 1.3 where possible with proper certificate management  
   - Implement certificate pinning for critical connections  
   - Regularly rotate certificates and verify their validity  

## 3. **AI-Specific Threat Protection** ðŸ¤–

**Prompt Injection Defense:**  
   - **Microsoft Prompt Shields**: Deploy AI Prompt Shields for advanced detection and filtering of malicious instructions  
   - **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks and confused deputy problems  
   - **Content Boundaries**: Use delimiter and datamarking systems to distinguish between trusted instructions and external content  

**Tool Poisoning Prevention:**  
   - **Tool Metadata Validation**: Implement integrity checks for tool definitions and monitor for unexpected changes  
   - **Dynamic Tool Monitoring**: Monitor runtime behavior and set up alerts for unexpected execution patterns  
   - **Approval Workflows**: Require explicit user approval for tool modifications and capability changes  

## 4. **Access Control & Permissions**

**Principle of Least Privilege:**  
   - Grant MCP servers only the minimum permissions required for intended functionality  
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions  
   - Regularly review permissions and continuously monitor for privilege escalation  

**Runtime Permission Controls:**  
   - Apply resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks  
   - Use container isolation for tool execution environments  
   - Implement just-in-time access for administrative functions  

## 5. **Content Safety & Monitoring**

**Content Safety Implementation:**  
   - **Azure Content Safety Integration**: Use Azure Content Safety to detect harmful content, jailbreak attempts, and policy violations  
   - **Behavioral Analysis**: Implement runtime behavioral monitoring to detect anomalies in MCP server and tool execution  
   - **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all authentication attempts, tool invocations, and security events with secure, tamper-proof storage  

**Continuous Monitoring:**  
   - Real-time alerting for suspicious patterns and unauthorized access attempts  
   - Integration with SIEM systems for centralized security event management  
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing of MCP implementations  

## 6. **Supply Chain Security**

**Component Verification:**  
   - **Dependency Scanning**: Use automated vulnerability scanning for all software dependencies and AI components  
   - **Provenance Validation**: Verify the origin, licensing, and integrity of models, data sources, and external services  
   - **Signed Packages**: Use cryptographically signed packages and verify signatures before deployment  

**Secure Development Pipeline:**  
   - **GitHub Advanced Security**: Implement secret scanning, dependency analysis, and CodeQL static analysis  
   - **CI/CD Security**: Integrate security validation throughout automated deployment pipelines  
   - **Artifact Integrity**: Implement cryptographic verification for deployed artifacts and configurations  

## 7. **OAuth Security & Confused Deputy Prevention**

**OAuth 2.1 Implementation:**  
   - **PKCE Implementation**: Use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for all authorization requests  
   - **Explicit Consent**: Obtain user consent for each dynamically registered client to prevent confused deputy attacks  
   - **Redirect URI Validation**: Implement strict validation of redirect URIs and client identifiers  

**Proxy Security:**  
   - Prevent authorization bypass through static client ID exploitation  
   - Implement proper consent workflows for third-party API access  
   - Monitor for authorization code theft and unauthorized API access  

## 8. **Incident Response & Recovery**

**Rapid Response Capabilities:**  
   - **Automated Response**: Implement automated systems for credential rotation and threat containment  
   - **Rollback Procedures**: Ability to quickly revert to known-good configurations and components  
   - **Forensic Capabilities**: Detailed audit trails and logging for incident investigation  

**Communication & Coordination:**  
   - Clear escalation procedures for security incidents  
   - Integration with organizational incident response teams  
   - Regular security incident simulations and tabletop exercises  

## 9. **Compliance & Governance**

**Regulatory Compliance:**  
   - Ensure MCP implementations meet industry-specific requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)  
   - Implement data classification and privacy controls for AI data processing  
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation for compliance auditing  

**Change Management:**  
   - Formal security review processes for all MCP system modifications  
   - Version control and approval workflows for configuration changes  
   - Regular compliance assessments and gap analysis  

## 10. **Advanced Security Controls**

**Zero Trust Architecture:**  
   - **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Continuous verification of users, devices, and connections  
   - **Micro-segmentation**: Granular network controls isolating individual MCP components  
   - **Conditional Access**: Risk-based access controls adapting to current context and behavior  

**Runtime Application Protection:**  
   - **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**: Deploy RASP techniques for real-time threat detection  
   - **Application Performance Monitoring**: Monitor for performance anomalies that may indicate attacks  
   - **Dynamic Security Policies**: Implement security policies that adapt based on current threat landscape
