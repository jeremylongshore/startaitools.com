# Implementing Azure Content Safety with MCP

To enhance MCP security against prompt injection, tool poisoning, and other AI-specific threats, integrating Azure Content Safety is highly recommended.

## Integration with MCP Server

To integrate Azure Content Safety with your MCP server, add the content safety filter as middleware in your request processing pipeline:

1. Initialize the filter during server startup  
2. Validate all incoming tool requests before processing  
3. Check all outgoing responses before sending them back to clients  
4. Log and alert on safety violations  
5. Implement proper error handling for failed content safety checks  

This setup provides strong protection against:  
- Prompt injection attacks  
- Tool poisoning attempts  
- Data exfiltration through malicious inputs  
- Generation of harmful content  

## Best Practices for Azure Content Safety Integration

1. **Custom Blocklists**: Develop custom blocklists tailored to MCP injection patterns  
2. **Severity Tuning**: Adjust severity thresholds according to your specific use case and risk tolerance  
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Apply content safety checks to all inputs and outputs  
4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching repeated content safety checks to improve performance  
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Define clear fallback procedures for when content safety services are unavailable  
6. **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback to users when content is blocked due to safety concerns  
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update blocklists and detection patterns based on new threats
