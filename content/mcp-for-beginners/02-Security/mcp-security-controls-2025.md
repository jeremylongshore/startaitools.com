# MCP Security Controls - August 2025 Update

> **Current Standard**: This document reflects [MCP Specification 2025-06-18](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/) security requirements and official [MCP Security Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices).

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has matured significantly with enhanced security controls addressing both traditional software security and AI-specific threats. This document provides comprehensive security controls for secure MCP implementations as of August 2025.

## **MANDATORY Security Requirements**

### **Critical Prohibitions from MCP Specification:**

> **FORBIDDEN**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server
>
> **PROHIBITED**: MCP servers **MUST NOT** use sessions for authentication  
>
> **REQUIRED**: MCP servers implementing authorization **MUST** verify ALL inbound requests
>
> **MANDATORY**: MCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically registered client

## 1. **Authentication & Authorization Controls**

### **External Identity Provider Integration**

**Current MCP Standard (2025-06-18)** allows MCP servers to delegate authentication to external identity providers, representing a significant security improvement:

### **External Identity Provider Integration**

**Current MCP Standard (2025-06-18)** allows MCP servers to delegate authentication to external identity providers, representing a significant security improvement:

**Security Benefits:**
1. **Eliminates Custom Authentication Risks**: Reduces vulnerability surface by avoiding custom authentication implementations
2. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Leverages established identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID with advanced security features
3. **Centralized Identity Management**: Simplifies user lifecycle management, access control, and compliance auditing
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Inherits MFA capabilities from enterprise identity providers
5. **Conditional Access Policies**: Benefits from risk-based access controls and adaptive authentication

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Token Audience Validation**: Verify all tokens are explicitly issued for the MCP server
- **Issuer Verification**: Validate token issuer matches expected identity provider
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic validation of token integrity
- **Expiration Enforcement**: Strict enforcement of token lifetime limits
- **Scope Validation**: Ensure tokens contain appropriate permissions for requested operations

### **Authorization Logic Security**

**Critical Controls:**
- **Comprehensive Authorization Audits**: Regular security reviews of all authorization decision points
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Deny access when authorization logic cannot make a definitive decision
- **Permission Boundaries**: Clear separation between different privilege levels and resource access
- **Audit Logging**: Complete logging of all authorization decisions for security monitoring
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodic validation of user permissions and privilege assignments

## 2. **Token Security & Anti-Passthrough Controls**

### **Token Passthrough Prevention**

**Token passthrough is explicitly prohibited** in the MCP Authorization Specification due to critical security risks:

**Security Risks Addressed:**
- **Control Circumvention**: Bypasses essential security controls like rate limiting, request validation, and traffic monitoring
- **Accountability Breakdown**: Makes client identification impossible, corrupting audit trails and incident investigation
- **Proxy-Based Exfiltration**: Enables malicious actors to use servers as proxies for unauthorized data access
- **Trust Boundary Violations**: Breaks downstream service trust assumptions about token origins
- **Lateral Movement**: Compromised tokens across multiple services enable broader attack expansion

**Implementation Controls:**
```yaml
Token Validation Requirements:
  audience_validation: MANDATORY
  issuer_verification: MANDATORY  
  signature_check: MANDATORY
  expiration_enforcement: MANDATORY
  scope_validation: MANDATORY
  
Token Lifecycle Management:
  rotation_frequency: "Short-lived tokens preferred"
  secure_storage: "Azure Key Vault or equivalent"
  transmission_security: "TLS 1.3 minimum"
  replay_protection: "Implemented via nonce/timestamp"
```

### **Secure Token Management Patterns**

**Best Practices:**
- **Short-Lived Tokens**: Minimize exposure window with frequent token rotation
- **Just-in-Time Issuance**: Issue tokens only when needed for specific operations
- **Secure Storage**: Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults
- **Token Binding**: Bind tokens to specific clients, sessions, or operations where possible
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Real-time detection of token misuse or unauthorized access patterns

## 3. **Session Security Controls**

### **Session Hijacking Prevention**

**Attack Vectors Addressed:**
- **Session Hijack Prompt Injection**: Malicious events injected into shared session state
- **Session Impersonation**: Unauthorized use of stolen session IDs to bypass authentication
- **Resumable Stream Attacks**: Exploitation of server-sent event resumption for malicious content injection

**Mandatory Session Controls:**
```yaml
Session ID Generation:
  randomness_source: "Cryptographically secure RNG"
  entropy_bits: 128 # Minimum recommended
  format: "Base64url encoded"
  predictability: "MUST be non-deterministic"

Session Binding:
  user_binding: "REQUIRED - <user_id>:<session_id>"
  additional_identifiers: "Device fingerprint, IP validation"
  context_binding: "Request origin, user agent validation"
  
Session Lifecycle:
  expiration: "Configurable timeout policies"
  rotation: "After privilege escalation events"
  invalidation: "Immediate on security events"
  cleanup: "Automated expired session removal"
```

**Transport Security:**
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All session communication over TLS 1.3
- **Secure Cookie Attributes**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict
- **Certificate Pinning**: For critical connections to prevent MITM attacks

### **Stateful vs Stateless Considerations**

**For Stateful Implementations:**
- Shared session state requires additional protection against injection attacks
- Queue-based session management needs integrity verification
- Multiple server instances require secure session state synchronization

**For Stateless Implementations:**
- JWT or similar token-based session management
- Cryptographic verification of session state integrity
- Reduced attack surface but requires robust token validation
