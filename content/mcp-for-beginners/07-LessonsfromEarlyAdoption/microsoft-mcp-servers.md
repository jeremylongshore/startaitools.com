## üîß Understanding MCP Servers: A Beginner's Guide

### What Are MCP Servers?

As a beginner to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), you might wonder: "What exactly is an MCP server, and why should I care?" Let's start with a simple analogy.

Think of MCP servers as specialized assistants that help your AI coding companion (like GitHub Copilot) connect to external tools and services. Just like how you might use different apps on your phone for different tasks‚Äîone for weather, one for navigation, one for banking‚ÄîMCP servers give your AI assistant the ability to interact with different development tools and services.

### The Problem MCP Servers Solve

Before MCP servers, if you wanted to:
- Check your Azure resources
- Create a GitHub issue 
- Query your database
- Search through documentation

You'd have to stop coding, open a browser, navigate to the appropriate website, and manually perform these tasks. This constant context switching breaks your flow and reduces productivity.

### How MCP Servers Transform Your Development Experience

With MCP servers, you can stay in your development environment (VS Code, Visual Studio, etc.) and simply ask your AI assistant to handle these tasks. For example:

**Instead of this traditional workflow:**
1. Stop coding
2. Open browser
3. Navigate to Azure portal
4. Look up storage account details
5. Return to VS Code
6. Resume coding

**You can now do this:**
1. Ask AI: "What's the status of my Azure storage accounts?"
2. Continue coding with the information provided

### Key Benefits for Beginners

#### 1. üîÑ **Stay in Your Flow State**
- No more switching between multiple applications
- Keep your focus on the code you're writing
- Reduce mental overhead of managing different tools

#### 2. ü§ñ **Use Natural Language Instead of Complex Commands**
- Instead of memorizing SQL syntax, describe what data you need
- Instead of remembering Azure CLI commands, explain what you want to accomplish
- Let AI handle the technical details while you focus on the logic

#### 3. üîó **Connect Multiple Tools Together**
- Create powerful workflows by combining different services
- Example: "Get all recent GitHub issues and create corresponding Azure DevOps work items"
- Build automation without writing complex scripts

#### 4. üåê **Access a Growing Ecosystem**
- Benefit from servers built by Microsoft, GitHub, and other companies
- Mix and match tools from different vendors seamlessly
- Join a standardized ecosystem that works across different AI assistants

#### 5. üõ†Ô∏è **Learn by Doing**
- Start with pre-built servers to understand the concepts
- Gradually build your own servers as you become more comfortable
- Use available SDKs and documentation to guide your learning

### Real-World Example for Beginners

Let's say you're new to web development and working on your first project. Here's how MCP servers can help:

**Traditional approach:**
```
1. Code a feature
2. Open browser ‚Üí Navigate to GitHub
3. Create an issue for testing
4. Open another tab ‚Üí Check Azure docs for deployment
5. Open third tab ‚Üí Look up database connection examples
6. Return to VS Code
7. Try to remember what you were doing
```

**With MCP servers:**
```
1. Code a feature
2. Ask AI: "Create a GitHub issue for testing this login feature"
3. Ask AI: "How do I deploy this to Azure according to the docs?"
4. Ask AI: "Show me the best way to connect to my database"
5. Continue coding with all the information you need
```

### The Enterprise Standard Advantage

MCP is becoming an industry-wide standard, which means:
- **Consistency**: Similar experience across different tools and companies
- **Interoperability**: Servers from different vendors work together

## Lesson Learnt from Microsoft MCP Servers üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. üìö Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Microsoft_Docs_MCP-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=microsoft.docs.mcp&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fapi%2Fmcp%22%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Microsoft_Docs_MCP-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=microsoft.docs.mcp&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fapi%2Fmcp%22%7D&quality=insiders) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_Repository-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp)

**What it does**: The Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server is a cloud-hosted service that provides AI assistants with real-time access to official Microsoft documentation through the Model Context Protocol. It connects to `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp` and enables semantic search across Microsoft Learn, Azure documentation, Microsoft 365 documentation, and other official Microsoft sources.

**Why it's useful**: While it may seem like "just documentation," this server is actually crucial for every developer using Microsoft technologies. One of the biggest complaints from .NET developers about AI coding assistants is that they're not up to date on the latest .NET and C# releases. The Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server solves this by providing real-time access to the most current documentation, API references, and best practices. Whether you're working with the latest Azure SDKs, exploring new C# 13 features, or implementing cutting-edge .NET Aspire patterns, this server ensures your AI assistant has access to the authoritative, up-to-date information it needs to generate accurate, modern code.

**Real-world use**: "What are the az cli commands to create an Azure container app according to official Microsoft Learn documentation?" or "How do I configure Entity Framework with dependency injection in ASP.NET Core?" Or how about "Review this code to make sure it matches the performance recommendations in the Microsoft Learn Documentation." The server provides comprehensive coverage across Microsoft Learn, Azure docs, and Microsoft 365 documentation using advanced semantic search to find the most contextually relevant information. It returns up to 10 high-quality content chunks with article titles and URLs, always accessing the latest Microsoft documentation as it's published.

**Featured example**: The server exposes the `microsoft_docs_search` tool that performs semantic search against Microsoft's official technical documentation. Once configured, you can ask questions like "How do I implement JWT authentication in ASP.NET Core?" and get detailed, official responses with source links. The search quality is exceptional because it understands context ‚Äì asking about "containers" in an Azure context will return Azure Container Instances documentation, while the same term in a .NET context returns relevant C# collection information.

This is especially useful for rapidly changing or recently updated libraries and use cases. For instance, in some recent coding projects I wanted to leverage features in the latest releases of .NET Aspire and Microsoft.Extensions.AI. By including the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP server, I was able to leverage not just API docs, but walkthroughs and guidance that had just been published.

> **üí° Pro Tip**
> 
> Even tool-friendly models need encouragement to use MCP tools! Consider adding a system prompt or [copilot-instructions.md](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/custom-instructions/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot) like: "You have access to `microsoft.docs.mcp` ‚Äì use this tool to search Microsoft's latest official documentation when handling questions about Microsoft technologies like C#, Azure, ASP.NET Core, or Entity Framework."
>
> For a great example of this in action, check out the [C# .NET Janitor chat mode](https://github.com/awesome-copilot/chatmodes/blob/main/csharp-dotnet-janitor.chatmode.md) from the Awesome GitHub Copilot repository. This mode specifically leverages the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP server to help clean up and modernize C# code using the latest patterns and best practices.
### 2. ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure MCP Server

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Azure_MCP-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=Azure%20MCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40azure%2Fazure-mcp%40latest%22%5D%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Azure_MCP-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=Azure%20MCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40azure%2Fazure-mcp%40latest%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_Repository-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp)

**What it does**: The Azure MCP Server is a comprehensive suite of 15+ specialized Azure service connectors that brings the entire Azure ecosystem into your AI workflow. This isn't just a single server ‚Äì it's a powerful collection that includes resource management, database connectivity (PostgreSQL, SQL Server), Azure Monitor log analysis with KQL, Cosmos DB integration, and much more.

**Why it's useful**: Beyond just managing Azure resources, this server dramatically improves code quality when working with Azure SDKs. When you use Azure MCP in Agent mode, it doesn't just help you write code ‚Äì it helps you write *better* Azure code that follows current authentication patterns, error handling best practices, and leverages the latest SDK features. Instead of getting generic code that might work, you get code that follows Azure's recommended patterns for production workloads.

**Key modules include**:
- **üóÑÔ∏è Database Connectors**: Direct natural language access to Azure Database for PostgreSQL and SQL Server
- **üìä Azure Monitor**: KQL-powered log analysis and operational insights
- **üåê Resource Management**: Full Azure resource lifecycle management
- **üîê Authentication**: DefaultAzureCredential and managed identity patterns
- **üì¶ Storage Services**: Blob Storage, Queue Storage, and Table Storage operations
- **üöÄ Container Services**: Azure Container Apps, Container Instances, and AKS management
- **And many more specialized connectors**

**Real-world use**: "List my Azure storage accounts", "Query my Log Analytics workspace for errors in the last hour", or "Help me build an Azure application using Node.js with proper authentication"

**Full demo scenario**: Here's a complete walkthrough that shows the power of combining Azure MCP with GitHub Copilot for Azure extension in VS Code. When you have both installed and prompt:

> "Create a Python script that uploads a file to Azure Blob Storage using DefaultAzureCredential authentication. The script should connect to my Azure storage account named 'mycompanystorage', upload to a container named 'documents', create a test file with the current timestamp to upload, handle errors gracefully and provide informative output, follow Azure best practices for authentication and error handling, include comments explaining how the DefaultAzureCredential authentication works, and make the script well-structured with proper functions and documentation."

The Azure MCP Server will generate a complete, production-ready Python script that:
- Uses the latest Azure Blob Storage SDK with proper async patterns
- Implements DefaultAzureCredential with comprehensive fallback chain explanation
- Includes robust error handling with specific Azure exception types
- Follows Azure SDK best practices for resource management and connection handling
- Provides detailed logging and informative console output
- Creates a properly structured script with functions, documentation, and type hints

What makes this remarkable is that without the Azure MCP, you might get generic blob storage code that works but doesn't follow current Azure patterns. With Azure MCP, you get code that leverages the latest authentication methods, handles Azure-specific error scenarios, and follows Microsoft's recommended practices for production applications.

**Featured example**: I've struggled with remembering the specific commands for the `az` and `azd` CLIs for ad-hoc use. It's always a two-step process for me: first look up the syntax, then run the command. I'll often just pop into the portal and click around to get work done because I don't want to admit I can't remember CLI syntax. Being able to just describe what I want is amazing, and even better to be able to do that without leaving my IDE!

There's a great list of use cases in the [Azure MCP repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#-what-can-you-do-with-the-azure-mcp-server) to get you started. For comprehensive setup guides and advanced configuration options, check out the [official Azure MCP documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/).

**What it does**: The official GitHub MCP Server provides seamless integration with GitHub's entire ecosystem, offering both hosted remote access and local Docker deployment options. This isn't just about basic repository operations ‚Äì it's a comprehensive toolkit that includes GitHub Actions management, pull request workflows, issue tracking, security scanning, notifications, and advanced automation capabilities.

**Why it's useful**: This server transforms how you interact with GitHub by bringing the full platform experience directly into your development environment. Instead of constantly switching between VS Code and GitHub.com for project management, code reviews, and CI/CD monitoring, you can handle everything through natural language commands while staying focused on your code.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: Different Types of 'Agents'**
> 
> Don't confuse this GitHub MCP Server with GitHub's Coding Agent (the AI agent you can assign issues to for automated coding tasks). The GitHub MCP Server works within VS Code's Agent mode to provide GitHub API integration, while GitHub's Coding Agent is a separate feature that creates pull requests when assigned to GitHub issues.

**Key capabilities include**:
- **‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions**: Complete CI/CD pipeline management, workflow monitoring, and artifact handling
- **üîÄ Pull Requests**: Create, review, merge, and manage PRs with comprehensive status tracking
- **üêõ Issues**: Full issue lifecycle management, commenting, labeling, and assignment
- **üîí Security**: Code scanning alerts, secret detection, and Dependabot integration
- **üîî Notifications**: Smart notification management and repository subscription control
- **üìÅ Repository Management**: File operations, branch management, and repository administration
- **üë• Collaboration**: User and organization search, team management, and access control

**Real-world use**: "Create a pull request from my feature branch", "Show me all failed CI runs this week", "List open security alerts for my repositories", or "Find all issues assigned to me across my organizations"

**Full demo scenario**: Here's a powerful workflow that demonstrates the GitHub MCP Server's capabilities:

> "I need to prepare for our sprint review. Show me all pull requests I've created this week, check the status of our CI/CD pipelines, create a summary of any security alerts we need to address, and help me draft release notes based on merged PRs with the 'feature' label."

The GitHub MCP Server will:
- Query your recent pull requests with detailed status information
- Analyze workflow runs and highlight any failures or performance issues
- Compile security scanning results and prioritize critical alerts
- Generate comprehensive release notes by extracting information from merged PRs
- Provide actionable next steps for sprint planning and release preparation

**Featured example**: I love using this for code review workflows. Instead of jumping between VS Code, GitHub notifications, and pull request pages, I can say "Show me all PRs waiting for my review" and then "Add a comment to PR #123 asking about the error handling in the authentication method." The server handles the GitHub API calls, maintains context about the discussion, and even helps me craft more constructive review comments.

**Authentication options**: The server supports both OAuth (seamless in VS Code) and Personal Access Tokens, with configurable toolsets to enable only the GitHub functionality you need. You can run it as a remote hosted service for instant setup or locally via Docker for complete control.

> **üí° Pro Tip**
> 
> Enable only the toolsets you need by configuring the `--toolsets` parameter in your MCP server settings to reduce context size and improve AI tool selection. For example, add `"--toolsets", "repos,issues,pull_requests,actions"` to your MCP configuration args for core development workflows, or use `"--toolsets", "notifications, security"` if you primarily want GitHub monitoring capabilities.
### 4. üîÑ Azure DevOps MCP Server

**What it does**: Connects to Azure DevOps services for comprehensive project management, work item tracking, build pipeline management, and repository operations.

**Why it's useful**: For teams using Azure DevOps as their primary DevOps platform, this MCP server eliminates the constant tab-switching between your development environment and Azure DevOps web interface. You can manage work items, check build statuses, query repositories, and handle project management tasks directly from your AI assistant.

**Real-world use**: "Show me all active work items in the current sprint for the WebApp project", "Create a bug report for the login issue I just found", or "Check the status of our build pipelines and show me any recent failures"

**Featured example**: You can easily check the status of your team's current sprint with a simple query like "Show me all active work items in the current sprint for the WebApp project" or "Create a bug report for the login issue I just found" without leaving your development environment.

### 5. üìù MarkItDown MCP Server

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_MarkItDown_MCP-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=MarkItDown%20MCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40microsoft%2Fmcp-markitdown%40latest%22%5D%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_MarkItDown_MCP-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=MarkItDown%20MCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40microsoft%2Fmcp-markitdown%40latest%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_Repository-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)

**What it does**: MarkItDown is a comprehensive document conversion server that transforms various file formats into high-quality Markdown, optimized for LLM consumption and text analysis workflows.

**Why it's useful**: Essential for modern documentation workflows! MarkItDown handles an impressive range of file formats while preserving critical document structure like headings, lists, tables, and links. Unlike simple text extraction tools, it focuses on maintaining semantic meaning and formatting that's valuable for both AI processing and human readability.

**Supported file formats**:
- **Office Documents**: PDF, PowerPoint (PPTX), Word (DOCX), Excel (XLSX/XLS)
- **Media Files**: Images (with EXIF metadata and OCR), Audio (with EXIF metadata and speech transcription)
- **Web Content**: HTML, RSS feeds, YouTube URLs, Wikipedia pages
- **Data Formats**: CSV, JSON, XML, ZIP files (recursively processes contents)
- **Publishing Formats**: EPub, Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
- **Email**: Outlook messages (.msg)
- **Advanced**: Azure Document Intelligence integration for enhanced PDF processing

**Advanced capabilities**: MarkItDown supports LLM-powered image descriptions (when provided with an OpenAI client), Azure Document Intelligence for enhanced PDF processing, audio transcription for speech content, and a plugin system for extending to additional file formats.

**Real-world use**: "Convert this PowerPoint presentation to Markdown for our documentation site", "Extract text from this PDF with proper heading structure", or "Transform this Excel spreadsheet into a readable table format"

**Featured example**: To quote the [MarkItDown docs](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#why-markdown):

> Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively "speak" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient.

MarkItDown is really good at preserving document structure, which is important for AI workflows. For instance, when converting a PowerPoint presentation, it keeps slide organization with the right headings, extracts tables as Markdown tables, includes alt text for images, and even processes the speaker notes. Charts get converted to readable data tables, and the resulting Markdown maintains the logical flow of the original presentation. This makes it perfect for feeding presentation content into AI systems or creating documentation from existing slides.
### 6. üóÉÔ∏è SQL Server MCP Server

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_SQL_Database-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=Azure%20SQL%20Database&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40azure%2Fmcp%40latest%22%2C%22server%22%2C%22start%22%2C%22--namespace%22%2C%22sql%22%5D%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_SQL_Database-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=Azure%20SQL%20Database&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40azure%2Fmcp%40latest%22%2C%22server%22%2C%22start%22%2C%22--namespace%22%2C%22sql%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_Repository-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp)

**What it does**: Provides conversational access to SQL Server databases (on-premises, Azure SQL, or Fabric)

**Why it's useful**: Similar to PostgreSQL server but for the Microsoft SQL ecosystem. Connect with a simple connection string and start querying with natural language ‚Äì no more context switching!

**Real-world use**: "Find all orders that haven't been fulfilled in the last 30 days" gets translated to appropriate SQL queries and returns formatted results

**Featured example**: Once you set up your database connection, you can start having conversations with your data immediately. The blog post shows this off with a simple question: "which database are you connected to?" The MCP server responds by invoking the appropriate database tool, connecting to your SQL Server instance, and returning details about your current database connection ‚Äì all without writing a single line of SQL. The server supports comprehensive database operations from schema management to data manipulation, all through natural language prompts.

**What it does**: Enables AI agents to interact with web pages for testing and automation

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Powering GitHub Copilot**
> 
> The Playwright MCP Server powers GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent, giving it web browsing capabilities! [Learn more about this feature](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-02-copilot-coding-agent-now-has-its-own-web-browser/).

**Why it's useful**: Perfect for automated testing driven by natural language descriptions. AI can navigate websites, fill forms, and extract data through structured accessibility snapshots ‚Äì this is incredibly powerful stuff!

**Real-world use**: "Test the login flow and verify that the dashboard loads correctly" or "Generate a test that searches for products and validates the results page" ‚Äì all without needing the application's source code

**Featured example**: My teammate Debbie O'Brien has been doing amazing work with the Playwright MCP Server lately! For example, she recently showed how you can generate complete Playwright tests without even having access to the application's source code. In her scenario, she asked Copilot to create a test for a movie search app: navigate to the site, search for "Garfield," and verify the movie appears in results. The MCP spun up a browser session, explored the page structure using DOM snapshots, figured out the right selectors, and generated a fully working TypeScript test that passed on the first run.

What makes this really powerful is that it bridges the gap between natural language instructions and executable test code. Traditional approaches require either manual test writing or access to the codebase for context. But with Playwright MCP, you can test external sites, client applications, or work in black-box testing scenarios where code access isn't available.


### 8. üíª Dev Box MCP Server

**What it does**: Manages Microsoft Dev Box environments through natural language

**Why it's useful**: Simplifies development environment management tremendously! Create, configure, and manage development environments without remembering specific commands.

**Real-world use**: "Set up a new Dev Box with the latest .NET SDK and configure it for our project", "Check the status of all my development environments", or "Create a standardized demo environment for our team presentations"

**Featured example**: I'm a big fan of using Dev Box for personal development. My lightbulb moment here was when James Montemagno explained how great Dev Box is for conference demos, since it's got a super-fast ethernet connection regardless of the conference / hotel / airplane wifi I may be using at the moment. In fact, I recently did some conference demo practice while my laptop was tethered to my phone hotspot while riding on a bus from Bruges to Antwerp! But my next step here is to dig into more team managing multiple development environments and standardized demo environments. And another big use case I've been hearing from customers and coworkers, of course, is using Dev Box for preconfigured development environments. In both cases, using an MCP to configure and manage Dev Boxes lets you use natural language interaction, all while staying in your development environment.

### 9. ü§ñ Azure AI Foundry MCP Server

**What it does**: The Azure AI Foundry MCP Server provides developers with comprehensive access to Azure's AI ecosystem, including model catalogs, deployment management, knowledge indexing with Azure AI Search, and evaluation tools. This experimental server bridges the gap between AI development and Azure's powerful AI infrastructure, making it easier to build, deploy, and evaluate AI applications.

**Why it's useful**: This server transforms how you work with Azure AI services by bringing enterprise-grade AI capabilities directly into your development workflow. Instead of switching between the Azure portal, documentation, and your IDE, you can discover models, deploy services, manage knowledge bases, and evaluate AI performance through natural language commands. It's particularly powerful for developers building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, managing multi-model deployments, or implementing comprehensive AI evaluation pipelines.

**Key developer capabilities**:
- **üîç Model Discovery & Deployment**: Explore Azure AI Foundry's model catalog, get detailed model information with code samples, and deploy models to Azure AI Services
- **üìö Knowledge Management**: Create and manage Azure AI Search indexes, add documents, configure indexers, and build sophisticated RAG systems
- **‚ö° AI Agent Integration**: Connect with Azure AI Agents, query existing agents, and evaluate agent performance in production scenarios
- **üìä Evaluation Framework**: Run comprehensive text and agent evaluations, generate markdown reports, and implement quality assurance for AI applications
- **üöÄ Prototyping Tools**: Get setup instructions for GitHub-based prototyping and access Azure AI Foundry Labs for cutting-edge research models

**Real-world developer use**: "Deploy a Phi-4 model to Azure AI Services for my application", "Create a new search index for my documentation RAG system", "Evaluate my agent's responses against quality metrics", or "Find the best reasoning model for my complex analysis tasks"

**Full demo scenario**: Here's a powerful AI development workflow:

> "I'm building a customer support agent. Help me find a good reasoning model from the catalog, deploy it to Azure AI Services, create a knowledge base from our documentation, set up an evaluation framework to test response quality, and then help me prototype the integration with GitHub token for testing."

The Azure AI Foundry MCP Server will:
- Query the model catalog to recommend optimal reasoning models based on your requirements
- Provide deployment commands and quota information for your preferred Azure region
- Set up Azure AI Search indexes with proper schema for your documentation
- Configure evaluation pipelines with quality metrics and safety checks
- Generate prototyping code with GitHub authentication for immediate testing
- Provide comprehensive setup guides tailored to your specific technology stack

**Featured example**: As a developer, I've struggled to keep up with the different LLM models available. I know a few main ones, but have been feeling like I'm missing out on some productivity and efficiency gains. And tokens and quotas are stressful and tough to manage ‚Äì I never know if I'm picking the right model for the right task or burning through my budget inefficiently. I just heard about this MCP Server from James Montemagno when checking around with teammates for MCP Server recommendations for this post, and I'm excited to put it to use! The model discovery capabilities look particularly impressive for someone like me who wants to explore beyond the usual suspects and find models that are optimized for specific tasks. The evaluation framework should help me validate that I'm actually getting better results, not just trying something new for the sake of it.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Experimental Status**
> 
> This MCP server is experimental and under active development. Features and APIs may change. Perfect for exploring Azure AI capabilities and building prototypes, but validate stability requirements for production use.

**What it does**: Provides developers with essential tools for building AI agents and applications that integrate with Microsoft 365 and Microsoft 365 Copilot, including schema validation, sample code retrieval, and troubleshooting assistance.

**Why it's useful**: Building for Microsoft 365 and Copilot involves complex manifest schemas and specific development patterns. This MCP server brings essential development resources directly into your coding environment, helping you validate schemas, find sample code, and troubleshoot common issues without constantly referencing documentation.

**Real-world use**: "Validate my declarative agent manifest and fix any schema errors", "Show me sample code for implementing a Microsoft Graph API plugin", or "Help me troubleshoot my Teams app authentication issues"

**Featured example**: I reached out to my friend John Miller after chatting with him at Build about M365 Agents, and he recommended this MCP. This could be great for developers new to M365 Agents since it provides templates, sample code, and scaffolding to get started without drowning in documentation. The schema validation features look particularly useful for avoiding manifest structure errors that can cause hours of debugging.

> **üí° Pro Tip**
> 
> Use this server alongside the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server for comprehensive M365 development support ‚Äì one provides the official documentation while this one offers practical development tools and troubleshooting assistance.
