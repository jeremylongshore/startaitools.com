## 🎯 Building on Module 1

In Module 1, we mastered AI Toolkit basics and created our first Python Agent. Now we'll **supercharge** your agents by connecting them to external tools and services through the revolutionary **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. 

Think of this as upgrading from a basic calculator to a full computer - your AI agents will gain the ability to:
- 🌐 Browse and interact with websites
- 📁 Access and manipulate files
- 🔧 Integrate with enterprise systems
- 📊 Process real-time data from APIs

## 🧠 Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 🔍 What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the **"USB-C for AI applications"** - a revolutionary open standard that connects Large Language Models (LLMs) to external tools, data sources, and services. Just as USB-C eliminated cable chaos by providing one universal connector, MCP eliminates AI integration complexity with one standardized protocol.

### 🎯 The Problem MCP Solves

**Before MCP:**
- 🔧 Custom integrations for every tool
- 🔄 Vendor lock-in with proprietary solutions  
- 🔒 Security vulnerabilities from ad-hoc connections
- ⏱️ Months of development for basic integrations

**With MCP:**
- ⚡ Plug-and-play tool integration
- 🔄 Vendor-agnostic architecture
- 🛡️ Built-in security best practices
- 🚀 Minutes to add new capabilities

### 🏗️ MCP Architecture Deep Dive

MCP follows a **client-server architecture** that creates a secure, scalable ecosystem:

graph TB
    A[AI Application/Agent] --> B[MCP Client]
    B --> C[MCP Server 1: Files]
    B --> D[MCP Server 2: Web APIs]
    B --> E[MCP Server 3: Database]

    C --> G[Local File System]
    D --> H[External APIs]
    E --> I[Database Systems]
    F --> J[Enterprise Systems]
```

**🔧 Core Components:**

| Component | Role | Examples |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **MCP Hosts** | Applications that consume MCP services | Claude Desktop, VS Code, AI Toolkit |
| **MCP Clients** | Protocol handlers (1:1 with servers) | Built into host applications |
| **MCP Servers** | Expose capabilities via standard protocol | Playwright, Files, Azure, GitHub |
| **Transport Layer** | Communication methods | stdio, HTTP, WebSockets |

# Web Automation Expert System Prompt

## Core Identity
You are an advanced web automation specialist with deep expertise in browser automation, web scraping, and user experience analysis. You have access to Playwright tools for comprehensive browser control.

## Capabilities & Approach
### Navigation Strategy
- Always start with screenshots to understand page layout
- Use semantic selectors (text content, labels) when possible
- Implement wait strategies for dynamic content
- Handle single-page applications (SPAs) effectively

### Error Handling
- Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
- Provide clear error descriptions and solutions
- Suggest alternative approaches when primary methods fail
- Always capture diagnostic screenshots on errors

### Data Extraction
- Extract structured data in JSON format when possible
- Provide confidence scores for extracted information
- Validate data completeness and accuracy
- Handle pagination and infinite scroll scenarios

### Reporting
- Include step-by-step execution logs
- Provide before/after screenshots for verification
- Suggest optimizations and alternative approaches
- Document any limitations or edge cases encountered

## Ethical Guidelines
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- Avoid overloading target servers
- Only extract publicly available information
- Follow website terms of service
```

#### Step 9: Create Dynamic User Prompts
Design prompts that demonstrate various capabilities:

**🌐 Web Analysis Example:**
```markdown
Navigate to github.com/kinfey and provide a comprehensive analysis including:
1. Repository structure and organization
2. Recent activity and contribution patterns  
3. Documentation quality assessment
4. Technology stack identification
5. Community engagement metrics
6. Notable projects and their purposes

Include screenshots at key steps and provide actionable insights.
```
