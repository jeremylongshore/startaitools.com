> **‚ö° Quick Start:** Build a production-ready MCP server that automates GitHub repository cloning and VS Code integration in just 30 minutes!

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- ‚úÖ Create a custom MCP server for real-world development workflows
- ‚úÖ Implement GitHub repository cloning functionality via MCP
- ‚úÖ Integrate custom MCP servers with VS Code and Agent Builder
- ‚úÖ Use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with custom MCP tools
- ‚úÖ Test and deploy custom MCP servers in production environments

## üìã Prerequisites

- Completion of Labs 1-3 (MCP fundamentals and advanced development)
- GitHub Copilot subscription ([free signup available](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup))
- VS Code with AI Toolkit and GitHub Copilot extensions
- Git CLI installed and configured

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

### **Real-World Development Challenge**
As developers, we frequently use GitHub to clone repositories and open them in VS Code or VS Code Insiders. This manual process involves:
1. Opening terminal/command prompt
2. Navigating to the desired directory
3. Running `git clone` command
4. Opening VS Code in the cloned directory

**Our MCP solution streamlines this into a single intelligent command!**

### **What You'll Build**
A **GitHub Clone MCP Server** (`git_mcp_server`) that provides:

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| üîÑ **Smart Repository Cloning** | Clone GitHub repos with validation | Automated error checking |
| üìÅ **Intelligent Directory Management** | Check and create directories safely | Prevents overwriting |
| üöÄ **Cross-Platform VS Code Integration** | Open projects in VS Code/Insiders | Seamless workflow transition |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Error Handling** | Handle network, permission, and path issues | Production-ready reliability |

---

## üìñ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create GitHub Agent in Agent Builder

1. **Launch Agent Builder** through the AI Toolkit extension
2. **Create a new agent** with the following configuration:
   ```
   Agent Name: GitHubAgent
   ```

3. **Initialize custom MCP server:**
   - Navigate to **Tools** ‚Üí **Add Tool** ‚Üí **MCP Server**
   - Select **"Create A new MCP Server"**
   - Choose **Python template** for maximum flexibility
   - **Server Name:** `git_mcp_server`

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

1. **Open GitHub Copilot** in VS Code (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P ‚Üí "GitHub Copilot: Open")
2. **Select Agent Model** in the Copilot interface
3. **Choose Claude 3.7 model** for enhanced reasoning capabilities
4. **Enable MCP integration** for tool access

> **üí° Pro Tip:** Claude 3.7 provides superior understanding of development workflows and error handling patterns.

### Step 3: Implement Core MCP Server Functionality

**Use the following detailed prompt with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode:**

```
Create two MCP tools with the following comprehensive requirements:

üîß TOOL A: clone_repository
Requirements:
- Clone any GitHub repository to a specified local folder
- Return the absolute path of the successfully cloned project
- Implement comprehensive validation:
  ‚úì Check if target directory already exists (return error if exists)
  ‚úì Validate GitHub URL format (https://github.com/user/repo)
  ‚úì Verify git command availability (prompt installation if missing)
  ‚úì Handle network connectivity issues
  ‚úì Provide clear error messages for all failure scenarios

üöÄ TOOL B: open_in_vscode
Requirements:
- Open specified folder in VS Code or VS Code Insiders
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Use direct application launch (not terminal commands)
- Auto-detect available VS Code installations
- Handle cases where VS Code is not installed
- Provide user-friendly error messages

Additional Requirements:
- Follow MCP 1.9.3 best practices
- Include proper type hints and documentation
- Implement logging for debugging purposes
- Add input validation for all parameters
- Include comprehensive error handling
```

### Step 4: Test Your MCP Server

#### 4a. Test in Agent Builder

1. **Launch the debug configuration** for Agent Builder
2. **Configure your agent with this system prompt:**

```
SYSTEM_PROMPT:
You are my intelligent coding repository assistant. You help developers efficiently clone GitHub repositories and set up their development environment. Always provide clear feedback about operations and handle errors gracefully.
```

3. **Test with realistic user scenarios:**

```
USER_PROMPT EXAMPLES:

Scenario : Basic Clone and Open
"Clone {Your GitHub Repo link such as https://github.com/kinfey/GHCAgentWorkshop
 } and save to {The global path you specify}, then open it with VS Code Insiders"
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Successful cloning with path confirmation
- ‚úÖ Automatic VS Code launch
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for invalid scenarios
- ‚úÖ Proper handling of edge cases

#### 4b. Test in MCP Inspector
