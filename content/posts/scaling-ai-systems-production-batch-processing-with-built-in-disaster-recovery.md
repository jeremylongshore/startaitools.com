<h2 id="the-challenge-scale-ai-documentation-across-235-production-systems">The Challenge: Scale AI Documentation Across 235 Production Systems</h2>
<p>When you maintain a plugin marketplace with 235 live integrations, manual documentation doesnâ€™t scale. Each plugin needed 8,000-14,000 byte enhancement files following official Anthropic standards - a multi-week manual effort.</p>
<p><strong>My approach:</strong> Build an overnight batch processing system using Vertex AI Gemini 2.0 Flash, staying entirely within free tier limits while maintaining 100% success rate and full disaster recovery capabilities.</p>
<p>This case study demonstrates systems thinking, risk management, and production-grade automation under real constraints.</p>
