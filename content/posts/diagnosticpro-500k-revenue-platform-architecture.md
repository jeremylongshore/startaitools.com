    # 1. Data preparation
    context = prepare_diagnostic_context(codes, symptoms, vehicle_info)

    # 2. Historical pattern matching
    similar_cases = query_bigquery_patterns(codes, vehicle_info)

    # 3. AI analysis with Gemini
    analysis = await gemini_analyze_diagnostic(context, similar_cases)

    # 4. Confidence scoring
    confidence = calculate_confidence_score(analysis, similar_cases)

    # 5. Report generation
    report = generate_diagnostic_report(analysis, confidence)

    return report
```

    return JSON.parse(cached);
  }

  // Generate new analysis if not cached
  const analysis = await generateDiagnostic(codes);
  await redis.setex(`diagnostic:${codeHash}`, 3600, JSON.stringify(analysis));
  return analysis;
};
```

**2. Database Query Optimization:**

    const endpoint = req.route.path;

    // Log performance metrics
    console.log({
      endpoint,
      method: req.method,
      duration,
      statusCode: res.statusCode,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });

    // Alert on slow responses
    if (duration > 200) {
      alertSlowResponse(endpoint, duration);
