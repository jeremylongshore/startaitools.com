<h1 id="hybrid-ai-stack-reduce-ai-api-costs-by-60-80-with-intelligent-request-routing">Hybrid AI Stack: Reduce AI API Costs by 60-80% with Intelligent Request Routing</h1>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Run lightweight LLMs locally on CPU for simple tasks, use cloud APIs only for complex requests. Save 60-80% on AI costs while maintaining quality. Production-ready Docker stack with full monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>AI API costs add up fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple question: <strong>$0.0009</strong> per request</li>
<li>Medium explanation: <strong>$0.0036</strong> per request</li>
<li>Complex code generation: <strong>$0.0159</strong> per request</li>
</ul>
<p>At <strong>200,000 requests/month</strong>, youâ€™re paying <strong>$774/month</strong> for cloud-only AI.</p>
