<p>I integrated my AI agent platform (Bob’s Brain) with Slack for a client project. The webhook verified successfully, messages flowed through, and responses came back. <strong>But every message triggered 6 duplicate responses.</strong></p>
<p>This wasn’t acceptable for production. Users would receive the same answer six times, creating confusion and making the system appear broken.</p>

<p><strong>Initial problem:</strong> The public tunnel service (localhost.run) kept changing URLs every few hours, requiring manual Slack configuration updates each time.</p>
