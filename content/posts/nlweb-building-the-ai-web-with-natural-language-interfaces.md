<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>NLWeb</strong> is an open-source framework from Microsoft that simplifies building conversational interfaces for websites. It represents a foundational shift in how we think about web interaction—moving from traditional search and navigation to natural language conversations with structured data.</p>
<p><strong>Key Innovation</strong>: NLWeb natively supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing the same natural language APIs to serve both humans and AI agents. As the project states: <em>“NLWeb is to MCP/A2A what HTML is to HTTP.”</em></p>
