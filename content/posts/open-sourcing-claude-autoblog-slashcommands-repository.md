---

Taking the custom slash commands we built and packaging them into a public GitHub repository for other developers to use. Here's the complete journey from private tooling to open-source release, including the pivot from general-purpose to specialized focus.

## The Starting Point: Custom Commands That Worked

We just built `/blog-startaitools` and `/blog-jeremylongshore` - custom Claude Code commands that automate the entire blog publishing workflow. They worked perfectly for my use case, analyzing git history and conversation context to generate blog posts automatically.

But they were just files sitting in `~/.claude/commands/` on my machine. No one else could benefit from them.

## The Decision: Make It Open Source

**"Is there a way to start a repo that is just about all my Claude Code commands I've made?"**

That question kicked off the open-source discussion. The value of these commands wasn't just for my workflow - other developers facing the same documentation friction could use them too.

## First Attempt: General Purpose Commands Repository

Initial plan was ambitious:
- Create `claude-code-commands` repository
- Include ALL custom commands (blog, documentation, project scaffolding)
- Make it a comprehensive collection

Started building:
```bash
mkdir ~/projects/claude-code-commands
mkdir commands docs examples
```

Began copying commands, writing documentation, creating examples...

## The Pivot: Focus on Blog Automation

Then came the realization: **"Should we have just forked github.com/wshobson/commands.git?"**

This triggered the key insight - there's already a general-purpose commands repository. What makes our commands special is the **blog automation focus**.

**Decision: Delete everything and start fresh with blog-specific scope.**

```bash
rm -rf ~/projects/claude-code-commands
```

Better to have a focused, specialized repository than try to be everything to everyone.

## Creating Claude-AutoBlog-SlashCommands

### Repository Naming

Went through iterations:
- `claude-code-blog-post-slash-command` (too long)
- `blog-slash-commands` (too generic)
- **`claude-AutoBlog-SlashCommands`** (clear, specific, memorable)

The name immediately tells you what it does: automated blog publishing via Claude Code slash commands.

### Repository Structure

Kept it simple and clear:
```
Claude-AutoBlog-SlashCommands/
├── README.md                        # Comprehensive overview
├── commands/
│   ├── blog-startaitools.md        # Technical blog command
│   └── blog-jeremylongshore.md     # Portfolio blog command
├── docs/                            # Future: detailed docs
├── examples/                        # Future: output examples
└── .gitignore
```

Start minimal, expand based on user needs.

### The README Philosophy

The README needed to answer immediately:
1. **What does this do?** - Automate blog publishing
2. **Why does it matter?** - Documentation friction is real
3. **How do I use it?** - Copy commands, customize, run
4. **Does it actually work?** - Real examples from live blogs

No fluff, no marketing speak. Just clear explanation of the problem and solution.

### Key Sections Included

**Quick Start** - Get running in 3 steps
```bash
git clone [repo]
cp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
/blog-startaitools  # Done
```

**Real-World Examples** - Links to actual generated posts
- Technical post: 330 lines, complete journey
- Portfolio post: 136 lines, professional narrative

**Philosophy** - Why we capture the journey, not just results
- Show troubleshooting
- Document what didn't work
- Different audiences need different narratives

**Requirements** - Be honest about dependencies
- Claude Code CLI
- Hugo static site
- Git with remote
- Auto-deploy setup (Netlify/similar)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Repository Setup

```bash
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-AutoBlog-SlashCommands.git
# (empty repo)

mkdir -p commands docs examples
cp ~/.claude/commands/blog-*.md commands/
```

### Initial Commit Structure

Kept it clean:
```
feat: initial release of automated blog publishing commands

- Add /blog-startaitools command for technical blog posts
- Add /blog-jeremylongshore command for portfolio blog posts
- Include comprehensive README with installation guide
- Commands analyze git history + conversation context
- Auto-publish workflow: analyze → generate → review → deploy
```

Single commit that encapsulates the complete feature set.

### GitHub Repository Configuration

- **Description**: Clear 350-word summary for SEO
- **Topics**: `claude-code`, `automation`, `blog-publishing`, `developer-tools`
- **License**: MIT (permissive, encourages adoption)
- **README badges**: None yet (keep it simple initially)

## What Makes This Repository Different

### 1. Specialized Focus

Not a general commands collection. Laser-focused on one problem: automated blog publishing from development work.

### 2. Production-Tested

These commands maintain two active blogs with 50+ posts combined. Not theoretical - actively used daily.

### 3. Complete Workflow

Don't just generate content - handle the entire pipeline:
- Context analysis
- Content generation
- Hugo build verification
- Git commit and push
- Deployment triggering

### 4. Educational Documentation

The commands themselves capture the journey:
- What you tried that failed
- Troubleshooting steps
- Iterative refinements
- Lessons learned

This philosophy extends to the repository documentation.

## Lessons from the Release Process

### 1. Scope Matters More Than Comprehensiveness

Better to do one thing extremely well than many things adequately. The pivot from general-purpose to blog-specific made the repository immediately more useful.

### 2. Real Examples Beat Explanations

Linking to actual generated blog posts (this one included) demonstrates value better than any marketing copy.

### 3. README is the Product

For developer tools, the README IS the product page. Invest time making it clear, honest, and actionable.

### 4. Start Minimal, Expand Based on Use

Released with just commands and README. Will add detailed docs, more examples, and additional commands based on actual user needs.

### 5. The Pivot is Part of the Story

Don't sanitize the process. The "should we fork?" moment and subsequent pivot is valuable context that shows decision-making process.

## Repository Stats

**Initial Release:**
- 2 commands
- 417 lines of code/docs
- 1 commit
- MIT license
- Public from day one

**Target Audience:**
- Developers with Hugo blogs
- Technical writers documenting development work

### Future Possibilities

- Additional commands for different blog platforms (Jekyll, Gatsby, etc.)
- Commands for other content types (newsletters, documentation, etc.)
- Integration examples with CI/CD pipelines
- Community contributions and variations

### Community Goals

- Gather feedback from real users
- Learn what customizations people need
- Identify which parts need better documentation
- Discover use cases we didn't anticipate

## The Meta Moment

This blog post about creating an open-source blog automation tool was generated by the very commands being released. The system documents its own creation and release.

**Workflow:**
1. Finished creating repository
2. Ran `/blog-startaitools`
3. Reviewed this draft
4. Approved for publishing
5. Auto-deployed to startaitools.com

From "we should open-source this" to published blog post in under an hour. The automation proves itself through use.
