The day started off well. I dropped my load this morning around 1:30 AM, and the next shipper was less than half a mile away, which worked out perfectly.

That's where the easy part ended. I had a long wait at the shipper, Nucor, today. I arrived at 2:30 PM and didn't leave until around 5:00 PM, after getting loaded with 40,000 pounds of steel beams. What really sucked was the cell service there. It was so bad that I couldn't get any work done online while I waited; everything just kept timing out. On the bright side, the forced downtime gave me a chance to pray and meditate.

On the work front, I tried to get my friend Jake on with the company I drive for, but it was a no-go. He wanted me to handle his dispatch, but Vasile said no. It's been an eventful day for Vasile, tooâ€”he had a hood fly off a car he was hauling and slam into a blue Ford.

As if the long wait wasn't enough, the day ended with a broken valve stem on my driver-side drive tires. Of course, it happened because I'm diligent about checking the tire pressure daily. In my attempt to remove it to install a new one, I managed to break the valve completely. Just one of those things.

On a much better note, I got my blood work back, and everything was cool in that department, which is always a relief.

The family is doing well. The kids had soccer today, which meant Mandy was busy with work and then carpooling them to and from practice. I didn't get to talk to her much, and I'm sure she'll be beat after a day like that.

Now, time to update the tech blog.
