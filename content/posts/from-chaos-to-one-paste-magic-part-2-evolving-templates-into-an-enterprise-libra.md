<p>In Part 1, I walked through how messy the repo had become and how I normalized everything. But cleanup was just the start. The real milestone came when I took @ryancarson’s excellent template foundation and evolved it into a 22-document enterprise-grade library that any CTO would be happy to run their teams on.</p>

<p>The original templates from @ryancarson — PRD, ADR, Generate Tasks, and Process Task List — were already powerful. They provided a structured backbone for planning and communication that was miles ahead of most documentation practices I’d seen.</p>
