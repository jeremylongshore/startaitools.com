<h2 id="the-journey-from-3-templates-to-16-in-one-session">The Journey: From 3 Templates to 16 in One Session</h2>
<p>Today I want to share an incredible AI pair programming session that transformed how I think about documentation. In just 4 hours with Claude, we built a comprehensive Professional Documentation Toolkit containing 16 LLM-optimized templates that cover the entire software development lifecycle.</p>
<h2 id="the-inspiration">The Inspiration</h2>
<p>It all started with a YouTube video by <a href="https://github.com/stulogy">stulogy</a> about his <a href="https://github.com/stulogy/vibe-prd">vibe-prd</a> project. His approach to structured AI-assisted development using PRD templates was brilliant. He showed how giving LLMs the right framework could transform vague AI responses into professional-grade documentation.</p>
