<p>The day started off well. I dropped my load this morning around 1:30 AM, and the next shipper was less than half a mile away, which worked out perfectly.</p>
<p>That’s where the easy part ended. I had a long wait at the shipper, Nucor, today. I arrived at 2:30 PM and didn’t leave until around 5:00 PM, after getting loaded with 40,000 pounds of steel beams. What really sucked was the cell service there. It was so bad that I couldn’t get any work done online while I waited; everything just kept timing out. On the bright side, the forced downtime gave me a chance to pray and meditate.</p>
