<h2 id="the-challenge-zero-to-production-in-72-hours">The Challenge: Zero to Production in 72 Hours</h2>
<p>In January 2025, we faced an ambitious challenge: build a production-ready data platform capable of ingesting, processing, and storing diagnostic data from multiple sources at massive scale. The requirements were clear but daunting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>254+ production tables</strong> in BigQuery</li>
<li><strong>Multiple data sources</strong>: YouTube API, Reddit (PRAW), GitHub repositories, RSS feeds</li>
<li><strong>Real-time processing</strong> with sub-100ms validation</li>
<li><strong>10,000 records/second</strong> bulk import capability</li>
<li><strong>Complete separation of concerns</strong> between data collection and storage</li>
<li><strong>72-hour deadline</strong> for production deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>What followed was an intense sprint of architectural design, rapid prototyping, and systematic deployment that resulted in a fully operational BigQuery data warehouse now running as <code>diagnostic-pro-start-up</code> on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
