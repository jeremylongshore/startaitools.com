<h2 id="the-problem-building-content-distribution-without-data-validation">The Problem: Building Content Distribution Without Data Validation</h2>
<p>Here’s a mistake I made this week: I proposed 33 RSS feeds for an automated content distribution system without testing a single one first.</p>
<p>The user’s response? “did u try the new feeds to ensure they match criteria for tier 1”</p>
<p>Ouch. But also - absolutely correct. What’s the point of designing an elegant multi-brand content routing system if half your data sources are broken?</p>
