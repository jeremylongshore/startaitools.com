<p>Building custom automation tools that transform how developers document and share their work. Todayâ€™s project: creating intelligent slash commands that analyze project context and generate technical content automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>Professional developers face a consistent challenge: maintaining quality documentation while staying productive. Technical blog posts that showcase expertise often get deprioritized because writing them requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reconstructing context after the work is complete</li>
<li>Manually reviewing git histories and code changes</li>
<li>Finding relevant cross-references to existing content</li>
<li>Managing the entire publishing workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>The friction between development work and documentation creates a gap where valuable insights go unshared.</p>
