 Overview
<p><a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a></p>
</h2>
<p><a href="https://imbalanced-learn.org/">Imbalanced-learn</a> is a Python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance. It is compatible with <a href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> and is part of the <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib">scikit-learn-contrib</a> projects.</p>

 Why Imbalanced-learn Matters
<p><a class="anchor" href="#why-imbalanced-learn-matters">#</a></p>
</h2>
<p>In real-world datasets, itâ€™s common to have imbalanced classes where one class significantly outnumbers others. This creates challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit Card Fraud</strong>: 99.9% legitimate transactions vs 0.1% fraudulent</li>
<li><strong>Medical Diagnosis</strong>: Rare diseases with few positive cases</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing Defects</strong>: Most products pass quality control</li>
<li><strong>Customer Churn</strong>: Typically only 2-5% of customers churn</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard machine learning algorithms often fail on imbalanced datasets, predicting only the majority class.</p>
