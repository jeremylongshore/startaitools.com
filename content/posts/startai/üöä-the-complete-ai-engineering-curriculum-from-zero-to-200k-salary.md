 The AI Engineering Revolution Is Here - And You’re Invited üéØ
<p><a class="anchor" href="#the-ai-engineering-revolution-is-here---and-youre-invited-">#</a></p>
</h1>
<p><strong>The numbers are insane:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$206,000</strong> - Average AI Engineer salary (up $50K from last year)</li>
<li><strong>24,000+</strong> - Open positions RIGHT NOW</li>
<li><strong>90%</strong> - Code at leading companies is now AI-generated</li>
<li><strong>18.7%</strong> - Salary premium over non-AI roles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The problem?</strong> Only 2.5% of these positions are entry-level.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ve created something special…</p>
