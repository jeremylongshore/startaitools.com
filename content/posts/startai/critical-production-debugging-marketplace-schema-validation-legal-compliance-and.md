<p><strong>Situation:</strong> 10:16 PM - User reports complete marketplace installation failure. ZERO users can install.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Debug and fix under time pressure while maintaining code quality and addressing legal compliance requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 31 minutes from bug report to deployed fix. Added legal pages, fixed CI/CD, deployed security headers.</p>
