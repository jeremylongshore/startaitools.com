<h1 id="from-github-repos-to-published-education-transforming-hidden-documentation">From GitHub Repos to Published Education: Transforming Hidden Documentation</h1>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Your best educational content is trapped in project README files and documentation folders, invisible to your audience.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Systematic content mining and transformation that turned two buried documentation projects into comprehensive published guides.</p>
<p><strong>The Result:</strong> 31KB of premium educational content now live, featuring a cost optimization guide worth $474/month in savings and a complete Terraform curriculum.</p>
<h2 id="the-discovery-phase">The Discovery Phase</h2>
<p>While working on the StartAITools educational platform, we realized a critical gap: comprehensive technical guides we’d written for internal projects weren’t published or discoverable.</p>
