<p>In the first two parts of this series, we took the repo from a messy, complex setup into a clean foundation with 22 enterprise-grade documents. Now, we flip the switch: this repo isn’t just a library of templates anymore — it’s a working AI-powered documentation pipeline.</p>
<p>With one paste in Claude Code CLI, or a structured workflow in Cursor IDE, anyone can generate a complete enterprise documentation suite in minutes. No Docker. No BMAD. No friction.</p>
