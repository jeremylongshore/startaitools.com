<h2 id="the-mystery-content-created-but-never-published">The Mystery: Content Created, But Never Published</h2>
<p>You ever have one of those debugging sessions where the problem seems impossible? The code works. The files are created. But… nothing shows up in production. That was my morning.</p>
<p>My custom Claude Code slash commands (<code>/blog-startaitools</code>, <code>/blog-single-startai</code>) were supposedly working. Claude would generate excellent blog posts, create the markdown files, run Hugo builds successfully, and claim everything was deployed. But when I checked startaitools.com? Nothing. The posts weren’t there.</p>
