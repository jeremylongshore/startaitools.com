<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Based in Gulf Shores, Alabama, I combine 20+ years of operations management with cutting-edge AI and automation expertise. Former Marine Corps Reservist and Citadel graduate who transitioned from managing multi-million dollar restaurant operations to building intelligent business systems.</p>
<p><strong>What sets me apart</strong>: I understand both sides - the operational challenges businesses face and the technical solutions that actually solve them.</p>
