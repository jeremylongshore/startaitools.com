<p>When youâ€™re building automation systems that need to work reliably across multiple brands and content categories, the quality of your data validation becomes critical. This week, I tackled the challenge of designing a scalable RSS feed validation and content distribution architecture - and learned valuable lessons about system design, data quality, and professional problem-solving.</p>

The initial approach seemed straightforward: collect RSS feeds, categorize them, and route content to the appropriate brand.</p>
