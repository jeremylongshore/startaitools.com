**N8N Data Synchronization Hub:**

#### CRM → Database → Analytics Pipeline
```javascript
// N8N Code Node Example - Customer Data Enrichment
const customerData = items[0].json;

// Enrich with external APIs
const enrichmentAPIs = [
  'clearbit.com/api/enrichment',
  'hunter.io/api/domain-search',
  'fullcontact.com/api/person'
];

const enrichedData = await Promise.all(
  enrichmentAPIs.map(api => fetchEnrichment(api, customerData))
);

// Merge and standardize
const standardizedCustomer = {
  id: customerData.id,
  email: customerData.email,
  company: enrichedData[0].company,
  socialProfiles: enrichedData[2].socialProfiles,
  lastEnriched: new Date().toISOString()
};

## Advanced N8N Features

### Custom Code Nodes

**JavaScript Power in Workflows:**
```javascript
// Advanced data transformation example
const processCustomerData = (items) => {
  return items.map(item => {
    const customer = item.json;
    
    // Calculate customer lifetime value
    const clv = customer.orders.reduce((total, order) => {
      return total + (order.value * order.frequency * 24); // 2-year projection
    }, 0);
    
    // Determine customer segment
    const segment = clv > 10000 ? 'Enterprise' : 
                    clv > 5000 ? 'Professional' : 'Standard';
    
    // Enrich with external APIs
    const enrichedCustomer = {
      ...customer,
      lifetimeValue: clv,
      segment: segment,
      riskScore: calculateChurnRisk(customer),
      nextBestAction: recommendAction(customer, segment),
      lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    return { json: enrichedCustomer };
  });
};
```

### Error Handling and Monitoring

**Production-Grade Reliability:**
```javascript
// Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await processData(inputData);
  
  // Success notification
  await sendSlackMessage({
    channel: '#automation-success',
    message: `✅ Processed ${result.length} records successfully`
  });
  
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  // Error logging and notification
  await logError({
    workflow: 'customer-processing',
    error: error.message,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    inputData: inputData
  });
  
  await sendSlackAlert({
    channel: '#automation-alerts',
    message: `🚨 Workflow failed: ${error.message}`,
    priority: 'high'
  });
  
  // Graceful fallback
  return { error: true, message: 'Processing failed, manual review required' };
}
```

### Webhook Security

**Secure External Integrations:**
```javascript
// Webhook validation and security
const validateWebhook = (headers, body, secret) => {
  const signature = headers['x-hub-signature-256'];
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(body)
    .digest('hex');
    
  return signature === `sha256=${expectedSignature}`;
};

// Rate limiting and IP whitelisting
const securityCheck = (request) => {
  const clientIP = request.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || request.ip;
  const allowedIPs = process.env.ALLOWED_IPS.split(',');
  
  if (!allowedIPs.includes(clientIP)) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized IP address');
  }
  
  // Rate limiting logic
  if (exceedsRateLimit(clientIP)) {
    throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded');
