# vibe-prd: From Blank Page to Professional Documentation in Minutes

We've all been there. You have a brilliant project idea, you open a blank Google Doc to write requirements, and then... you stare at the cursor for 20 minutes thinking "wtf do I write?"

Today I'm releasing **vibe-prd** - a tool that transforms a simple 9-question form into 22 professional documents instantly. No more googling "how to write a PRD" or starting from scratch.

## The Problem Every Developer Knows

Whether you're a solo developer, startup founder, or part of a small team, documentation is both critical and painful. You know you need:

- Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Technical Specifications
- API Documentation
- User Stories
- Risk Assessments
- Implementation Plans

But where do you start? What sections should you include? How do you make it look professional?

Most of us end up with amateur-looking docs or skip documentation entirely. Neither is good.

## What vibe-prd Does

vibe-prd solves this with a simple workflow:

1. **Answer 9 questions** about your project (takes ~5 minutes)
2. **AI analyzes** your responses and generates insights
3. **Get 22 professional documents** with all the right sections filled in

### The Magic: Form ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Templates

```bash
# Install (30 seconds)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd/main/ai-dev -o /usr/local/bin/ai-dev && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ai-dev

# Answer questions about your project
make ai-dev

# Generate everything
make prd
```

That's it. You get:

- **BMAD native analysis** in `docs/bmad/`
- **22 professional templates** in `docs/templates/`

## What You Actually Get

### Core Documents
- **Product Requirements Document** - What you're building and why
- **Technical Specification** - How you're going to build it
- **API Documentation** - Endpoint specs and integration guides
- **User Stories & Personas** - Features from the user's perspective
- **Risk Assessment** - What could go wrong and mitigation strategies
- **Implementation Plan** - Tasks broken down into actionable items

### Business Documents
- **Competitive Analysis** - Market positioning and differentiation
- **Roadmap** - Feature timeline and prioritization
- **Compliance Plan** - Regulatory and security requirements
- **Metrics & KPIs** - How you'll measure success

### Operational Documents
- **Runbook** - How to deploy and maintain the system
- **Post-mortem Template** - Incident response and learning
- **Test Plan** - Quality assurance strategy
- **Deployment Plan** - Release and rollback procedures

**And 8 more** comprehensive templates covering everything from data models to security reviews.

## Why It's Different

### üêã **Docker Containerized**
No dependency hell. No "works on my machine." The AI backend runs in a pinned container that works the same everywhere.

### üîÑ **Auto-Updating AI Backend**
Uses Renovate to automatically update the AI container. You always get the latest capabilities without manual updates.

### ‚ö° **Zero Setup Friction**
One curl command installs everything. No API keys, no cloud accounts, no complex configuration.

### üì± **Offline Capable**
After the initial container pull, works completely offline. Perfect for secure environments or airplane coding.

### üéØ **Professional Output**
Templates are based on industry standards. No more amateur-looking docs that make you cringe in investor meetings.

## Real Example: Building a Login System

Let's say you're adding authentication to your app. Here's what the 9-question form might look like:

```
Project Overview: Adding secure user authentication to our marketplace app
Target Users: Small business owners who need to manage their online presence
Value Proposition: Secure, frictionless login that builds trust
Goals:
- Goal 1: Reduce signup friction by 50%
- Goal 2: Implement OAuth social login
Constraints: Must integrate with existing PostgreSQL database; 6-week timeline
Compliance: GDPR compliance required for EU users
Risks: Password reset flow complexity; social login provider outages
Assumptions: Users prefer social login over email/password
Success Criteria: 90%+ login success rate; <2 second auth response time
```

From this, vibe-prd generates:

- **PRD** with problem statement, success metrics, user journeys
- **Tech Spec** covering OAuth implementation, database schema, security considerations
- **API Docs** for authentication endpoints with examples
- **User Stories** for different authentication flows
- **Risk Register** identifying OAuth provider dependencies
- **Test Plan** covering security, performance, and edge cases
- **And 16 more documents** covering every aspect of the feature

## Architecture: BMAD + Professional Templates

vibe-prd uses a two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: BMAD Analysis
The [BMAD (Business Model Analysis & Design) framework](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/bmad) analyzes your form responses and generates structured insights about your project.

### Phase 2: Template Generation
Those insights are automatically filled into 22 professional document templates, giving you both AI analysis and industry-standard structure.

```
Form Input ‚Üí BMAD Container ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Template Engine ‚Üí 22 Documents
```

## Perfect For

### üöÄ **Startup Founders**
Need to look professional to investors? Stop submitting amateur docs. Get investor-ready documentation that shows you know what you're doing.

### üë®‚Äçüíª **Solo Developers**
Building side projects? Proper documentation makes you look serious and helps with maintenance. Plus, if your project takes off, you're already prepared.

### üè¢ **Small Teams**
Don't have dedicated PMs or technical writers? vibe-prd gives you enterprise-quality documentation without enterprise overhead.

### üìù **Anyone Tired of Blank Pages**
If you've ever stared at an empty document wondering what to write, this tool is for you.

## Open Source & Community

vibe-prd is completely open source. The repository includes:

- ‚úÖ Full source code and templates
- ‚úÖ Docker containerization setup
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Auto-updating infrastructure

**GitHub**: https://github.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd

## Getting Started

### Quick Install
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd/main/ai-dev -o /usr/local/bin/ai-dev && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ai-dev
```

### First Use
```bash
cd ~/my-project
ai-dev make help  # See all available templates
ai-dev make create T=create-prd.md N=my-feature.md  # Create individual documents
```

### Full Workflow
```bash
make ai-dev  # Answer the 9 questions
make prd     # Generate everything
```

Check the `docs/` folder for your professional documentation suite.

## The Bigger Picture

vibe-prd is part of a larger trend toward **AI-assisted development workflows**. Instead of replacing human creativity, it handles the tedious parts (structure, formatting, section organization) so you can focus on the creative parts (vision, strategy, implementation).

This is what the future of documentation looks like:
- **AI handles structure** ‚Üí You focus on content
- **Templates ensure consistency** ‚Üí You focus on customization
- **Automation handles updates** ‚Üí You focus on building

## What's Next

I'm working on several enhancements:

- **Custom template support** - Add your own document types
- **Integration APIs** - Connect with project management tools
- **Multi-language support** - Generate docs in different languages
- **Team collaboration features** - Shared templates and workflows
