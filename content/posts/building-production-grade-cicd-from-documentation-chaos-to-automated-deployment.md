<h2 id="the-professional-challenge">The Professional Challenge</h2>
<p>I spent today tackling a problem every growing engineering team faces: the gap between “it works on my machine” and true production readiness. My youth sports statistics platform (HustleStats) had reached that critical inflection point where manual deployments and scattered documentation were becoming serious technical debt.</p>
<p>The wake-up call came in the form of multiple failed deployment emails. ESLint failures. Workflow conflicts. Wrong GCP project references. The kind of cascading issues that signal deeper systemic problems rather than isolated bugs.</p>
