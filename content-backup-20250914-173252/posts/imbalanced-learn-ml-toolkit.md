## Overview

[Imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/) is a Python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance. It is compatible with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) and is part of the [scikit-learn-contrib](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib) projects.

## Why Imbalanced-learn Matters

In real-world datasets, it's common to have imbalanced classes where one class significantly outnumbers others. This creates challenges:

- **Credit Card Fraud**: 99.9% legitimate transactions vs 0.1% fraudulent
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Rare diseases with few positive cases
- **Manufacturing Defects**: Most products pass quality control
- **Customer Churn**: Typically only 2-5% of customers churn

Standard machine learning algorithms often fail on imbalanced datasets, predicting only the majority class.

## Key Features

### 1. Over-sampling Methods
- **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- **ADASYN** (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)
- **BorderlineSMOTE** and variants
- **Random over-sampling**

### 2. Under-sampling Methods
- **Tomek Links**
- **Edited Nearest Neighbors**
- **Condensed Nearest Neighbors**
- **Random under-sampling**

### 3. Combination Methods
- **SMOTEENN** (SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbors)
- **SMOTETomek** (SMOTE + Tomek Links)

### 4. Ensemble Methods
- **BalancedRandomForestClassifier**
- **BalancedBaggingClassifier**
- **RUSBoostClassifier**
- **EasyEnsembleClassifier**

## Quick Start Example

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Assuming X and y are your features and target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE to balance the training data
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Train your model on balanced data
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced)

# Evaluate on original imbalanced test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install imbalanced-learn

# Using conda
conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn

# From source
git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn.git
cd imbalanced-learn
pip install .
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Never Balance the Test Set**
Only balance training data. Test on the original distribution to get realistic performance metrics.

### 2. **Cross-Validation Strategy**
Use `StratifiedKFold` to maintain class distribution across folds:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('sampler', SMOTE()),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])
```

### 3. **Choose the Right Technique**
- **Small dataset**: Prefer over-sampling (SMOTE)
- **Large dataset**: Consider under-sampling
- **Noisy data**: Use cleaning methods (Tomek Links)
- **Ensemble preference**: Try BalancedRandomForest

### 4. **Monitor Multiple Metrics**
Don't rely only on accuracy. Use:
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC and PR-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Class-specific metrics

## Integration with ML Pipelines

Imbalanced-learn integrates seamlessly with scikit-learn pipelines:

```python
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline as ImbPipeline
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

pipeline = ImbPipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('sampler', SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')),
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier())
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **imbalanced-learn** | Scikit-learn compatible, comprehensive methods | Python-only | General ML projects |
| **Class weights** | Simple, no data generation | Limited effectiveness | Quick baseline |
| **Custom sampling** | Full control | Time-consuming | Specific requirements |
| **ROSE (R)** | Good for R users | Not Python | R ecosystem |

## Advanced Techniques

### Custom Sampling Strategy
```python
# Define custom ratio for each class
sampling_strategy = {0: 1000, 1: 1000, 2: 500}
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy=sampling_strategy)
```

### Combining with Feature Selection
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('feature_selection', SelectKBest(k=10)),
    ('sampler', SMOTE()),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Data Leakage**: Apply resampling only on training data
2. **Over-reliance on Accuracy**: Use appropriate metrics for imbalanced data
3. **Ignoring Domain Knowledge**: Sometimes imbalance reflects reality
4. **Not Trying Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Consider adjusting class weights first
