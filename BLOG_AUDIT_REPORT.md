## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

### ROOT CAUSE: Timezone Future-Dating Bug

**Problem**: Your Waygate MCP v2.1.0 blog post wasn't appearing on your live site due to a **timezone conversion error** that caused Hugo to treat it as "future content."

**Technical Details**:
- **Original Date**: `2025-09-28T20:50:00-06:00` (Mountain Time)
- **UTC Conversion**: `2025-09-29T02:50:00 UTC` (September 29th)
- **Impact**: Hugo/Netlify excluded post from build as "future content"
- **Hugo Config Timezone**: `America/Chicago` (Central Time)
- **Netlify Build Environment**: UTC

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed time from `20:50` to `14:50` (Mountain Time)
- Post now publishes correctly on September 28th across all timezones

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Timezone Best Practices**
- Always use timezone-safe times for blog posts
- Consider your build environment timezone (Netlify uses UTC)
- Test dates that cross timezone boundaries

### 2. **Content Dating Guidelines**
```yaml
# SAFE - Guaranteed to be in the past
date: 2025-09-28T12:00:00-06:00

# RISKY - Might be future in UTC
date: 2025-09-28T20:00:00-06:00

# SAFEST - Always use UTC for consistency
date: 2025-09-28T18:00:00Z
```

### 3. **Debugging Workflow**
For future issues, check in order:
1. ✅ Content exists in repository
2. ✅ Hugo builds without errors
3. ✅ Generated files exist in public/
4. ✅ Content appears on development server
5. ❌ **If missing from live site: Check dates!**
