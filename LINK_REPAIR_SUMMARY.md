# Hugo Blog Link Repair - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Site:** https://startaitools.com/research/
**Status:** ✅ ALL LINKS FIXED AND VERIFIED

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Identified
The `/research/` page had **3 broken internal links** caused by:
1. **Incorrect URL paths** - Path structure didn't match Hugo's generated URLs
2. **Unicode character encoding** - Literal unicode characters instead of URL-encoded equivalents
3. **Truncated slugs** - URLs cut off before the full post slug

### Hugo Configuration Status
✅ **Config is CORRECT** - No Hugo configuration issues found:
- `baseURL = "https://startaitools.com/"` ✓
- `permalinks.posts = "/posts/:slug/"` ✓
- Taxonomies properly configured ✓
- Menu navigation working ✓

## Links Fixed

### 1. Hybrid AI Stack
**Location:** content/research.md:16

❌ **Before:** `/posts/hybrid-ai-stack-reduce-costs-60-80-percent-intelligent-routing/`
✅ **After:** `/posts/hybrid-ai-stack-reduce-ai-api-costs-by-60-80-with-intelligent-request-routing/`

**Issue:** Path didn't match actual Hugo-generated URL
**Solution:** Updated to match full generated slug

### 2. Complete AI Engineering Curriculum  
**Location:** content/research.md:17

❌ **Before:** `/posts/startai/üöä-the-complete-ai-engineering-curriculum-from-zero-to-200k-salary/`
✅ **After:** `/posts/%C3%BC%C3%B6%C3%A4-the-complete-ai-engineering-curriculum-from-zero-to-200k-salary/`

**Issue:** Raw unicode characters (üöä) not URL-encoded
**Solution:** Converted to proper URL encoding (%C3%BC%C3%B6%C3%A4)

### 3. Scaling AI Inference to Billions
**Location:** content/research.md:19

❌ **Before:** `/posts/startai/scaling-ai-inference-to-billions-of-users-and-agents-google-clouds-decade-long-j/`
✅ **After:** `/posts/scaling-ai-inference-to-billions-of-users-and-agents-google-clouds-decade-long-journey/`

**Issues:** 
- Incorrect `/startai/` prefix in path
- Truncated slug (ended with `-j/` instead of `-journey/`)

**Solution:** Removed wrong prefix and completed full slug

## Files Modified

**Single File Changed:**
- `content/research.md` (3 link corrections on lines 16, 17, 19)

**Git Commit:**
```
commit 2725a79b
fix: repair 3 broken links on research page
```

## Remaining Work

### No Critical Issues Found

All major navigation links verified working:
- ✅ Research & Curriculum index page
- ✅ All featured research papers accessible
- ✅ Platform engineering case studies working
- ✅ Developer tools & documentation links functional
- ✅ Security & Linux systems content available

### Recommendations

1. **Future Prevention:**
   - Use Hugo's `ref` and `relref` shortcodes for internal links
   - Example: `{{< ref "posts/my-post.md" >}}`
   - This auto-generates correct URLs even if slugs change

2. **Link Validation:**
   - Consider adding `htmltest` or similar to CI/CD
   - Catches broken links before deployment

3. **Content Organization:**
   - Current structure is clean and working
   - No reorganization needed

## Technical Details

**Hugo Version:** v0.150.0
**Theme:** Archie
**Build Command:** `hugo --gc --minify --cleanDestinationDir`
**Deployment:** Netlify (auto-deploy on push to master)

**Permalink Structure:**
- Posts: `/posts/:slug/`
- Research: `/research/:slug/`
- Custom sections: `/:section/:slug/`

---

## Conclusion

**All broken links have been systematically identified, fixed, and verified.**

The root cause was **human error in manual link construction**, not Hugo configuration issues. The fix involved correcting 3 URLs in `content/research.md` to match Hugo's actual generated paths.

**Site is now fully functional with all research content accessible.**
