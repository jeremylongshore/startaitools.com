# Day One: Starting My Tech Journey Blog

Today marks the beginning of something I've been meaning to do for a long time - documenting my journey in tech, AI, and entrepreneurship. After years of building solutions for clients, deploying AI systems, and solving complex technical challenges, I've decided it's time to share these experiences.

## Why Now?

The tech landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. AI isn't just a buzzword anymore - it's transforming how we build, deploy, and think about software. Every day brings new challenges, discoveries, and "aha" moments that are too valuable to keep to myself.

## What You Can Expect

This blog will be a raw, unfiltered look at:

- **Real Project Challenges:** The actual problems I face building AI solutions for clients, and how I solve them
- **Technical Deep Dives:** From BigQuery data pipelines processing 500K+ records daily to deploying LLMs in production
- **AI Implementation Stories:** Taking AI from concept to deployed solution in 48-72 hours
- **Tools & Workflows:** The practical tools and automation workflows that actually work
- **Failures & Lessons:** Because the failures teach us more than the successes

## My Current Stack

For those curious, here's what I'm currently working with:

- **AI/ML:** Gemini Vertex AI, Claude Code, custom RAG implementations
- **Data:** BigQuery, 266+ production tables, real-time data pipelines
- **Development:** Python, Go, JavaScript, with a focus on cloud-native solutions
- **Automation:** n8n workflows, custom integrations, API orchestration
- **Platforms:** GCP, AWS, Vercel, Netlify

## The Journey So Far

I've been fortunate to work on some incredible projects:

- Built DiagnosticPro, generating $500K+ in revenue with AI-powered automotive diagnostics
- Deployed automated news intelligence systems processing 100+ articles daily
- Created data pipelines handling millions of records from YouTube, Reddit, and GitHub
- Delivered 50+ projects with a 98% client satisfaction rate

But this is just the beginning.

## What's Next?

Tomorrow, I'll be diving into a new challenge - probably something involving LLMs, data pipelines, or both. Whatever it is, I'll document it here. The successes, the failures, the 3 AM debugging sessions, and the moments when everything just clicks.

## Join Me

If you're interested in AI, building practical solutions, or just enjoy reading about someone figuring things out as they go, follow along. This journey is about learning, building, and sharing knowledge with the community.
