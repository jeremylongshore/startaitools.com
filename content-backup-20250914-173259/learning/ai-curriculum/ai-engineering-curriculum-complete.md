# The AI Engineering Revolution Is Here - And You're Invited üéØ

**The numbers are insane:**
- **$206,000** - Average AI Engineer salary (up $50K from last year)
- **24,000+** - Open positions RIGHT NOW
- **90%** - Code at leading companies is now AI-generated
- **18.7%** - Salary premium over non-AI roles

**The problem?** Only 2.5% of these positions are entry-level.

That's why I've created something special...

## üî• [**Access the Complete Interactive Curriculum HERE**](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/)

## What Makes This Different From Everything Else

This isn't another "Learn Python in 30 Days" course. This is a **production-focused, industry-aligned curriculum** based on:

‚úÖ **Real company implementations** (Bell Canada, DoorDash, Spotify serving 675M users)
‚úÖ **Latest 2024-2025 technology** (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, vLLM, distributed inference)
‚úÖ **Actual production code** (not toy examples that break in real world)
‚úÖ **Cost optimization strategies** (save 80-90% on API costs)
‚úÖ **Enterprise deployment patterns** (handle millions of users with 99.9% uptime)

### Built on Proven Research

This curriculum incorporates insights from **"The AI Engineering Continuum: A White Paper on the Levels of System Mastery"** and reflects real-world practices from companies processing billions of AI requests daily.

## The Four-Level Mastery Path üéØ

### [**Level 1: Using AI**](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-1.html)
**Weeks 1-8: Master the Fundamentals That 90% Get Wrong**

- **Advanced prompt engineering** (Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, Thread of Thought)
- **Multi-provider API mastery** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face)
- **Token optimization** (save thousands on API costs)
- **Real production patterns** (not classroom theory)
- **Security & compliance** (OWASP for AI, data privacy, audit trails)

üí° **Projects:** Build AI-powered customer support, content generation pipeline, code review automation

### [**Level 2: Integrating AI**](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-2.html)
**Weeks 9-16: Build Intelligence Into Real Systems**

- **RAG implementation** (vector databases, embedding strategies, hybrid search)
- **Agent development** (tool use, planning, memory management)
- **Production deployment** (Docker, Kubernetes, serverless)
- **Real-time processing** (streaming, WebSockets, event-driven)
- **Cost optimization** (caching, batching, model selection)

üöÄ **Projects:** Enterprise search system, multi-agent customer service, AI-powered analytics dashboard

### [**Level 3: Engineering AI Systems**](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-3.html)
**Weeks 17-24: Create Production-Grade Solutions**

- **Fine-tuning mastery** (LoRA, QLoRA, distributed training)
- **Custom model deployment** (vLLM, TensorRT, edge deployment)
- **Advanced architectures** (mixture of experts, multi-modal systems)
- **Performance optimization** (GPU utilization, memory management)
- **Enterprise integration** (SSO, RBAC, audit logging)

‚ö° **Projects:** Custom LLM for your domain, production inference server, enterprise AI platform

### [**Level 4: Optimizing AI at Scale**](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-4.html)
**Weeks 25-32: Deploy Enterprise-Grade Systems**

- **Distributed inference** (model parallelism, pipeline parallelism)
- **Multi-region deployment** (latency optimization, failover)
- **Advanced monitoring** (drift detection, performance metrics)
- **Cost management** (spot instances, reserved capacity, hybrid cloud)
- **Compliance & governance** (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2)

üèóÔ∏è **Projects:** Multi-tenant AI platform, global inference infrastructure, enterprise MLOps pipeline

## Real Companies, Real Results üéØ

This curriculum is based on actual implementations at:

- **Bell Canada**: Serving millions with AI-powered support
- **DoorDash**: Processing billions of delivery optimizations
- **Spotify**: Personalizing for 675M users
- **Anthropic**: Building frontier models
- **Scale AI**: Processing petabytes of training data

## The Teaching Manual Difference üìö

Each level includes a **complete teaching manual** with:

- **45-minute lesson plans** (ready to use)
- **Live coding examples** (with error handling)
- **Assessment rubrics** (industry-aligned)
- **Project templates** (production-ready)
- **Common pitfalls** (and how to avoid them)

## Start Your Journey Today üöÄ

### Three Ways to Use This Curriculum:

1. **Self-Study**: Complete at your own pace with all materials freely available
2. **Bootcamp Format**: 32-week intensive program with structured milestones
3. **University Integration**: Full semester courses with academic rigor

### Quick Start Guide:

```bash
# Clone the curriculum
git clone https://github.com/jeremylongshore/ai-engineering-curriculum.git

# Start with Level 1
cd level-1-using-ai/
cat README.md

# Access the interactive version
open https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/
```

## The $200K Question üí∞

**"Is this really enough to get a $200K job?"**

The curriculum covers everything tested in FAANG+ AI engineering interviews:
- System design for AI (tested at Meta, Google)
- Production deployment (tested at Amazon, Microsoft)
- Cost optimization (tested at startups to Fortune 500)
- Scaling challenges (tested at OpenAI, Anthropic)

Plus real portfolio projects that demonstrate production experience.

## Join the Revolution üî•

The AI engineering wave is here. The question isn't whether to learn these skills - it's whether you'll learn them now while the opportunity is massive, or later when everyone else has caught up.
