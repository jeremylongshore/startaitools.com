# News Tracker - Automated Content Aggregation

**Status:** ðŸ”„ Integrated into N8N Workflows
**Period:** August - September 2025
**Tech Stack:** N8N, JSON Processing, RSS Feeds, API Integration
**Location:** `/projects/n8n-workflows/News_Tracker/`

## Project Overview

News Tracker is an automated news aggregation and tracking system that became a core component of the N8N workflow automation suite. It processes multiple news sources, extracts relevant content, and feeds into various automated pipelines.

## Key Features

### Data Collection
- **RSS Feed Processing** - Monitors 50+ news sources
- **API Integration** - Direct API connections to major news platforms
- **Content Filtering** - Smart filtering based on keywords and relevance
- **Duplicate Detection** - Prevents redundant content storage

### Processing Pipeline
- **JSON Data Structures** - Standardized data format for all sources
- **Content Enrichment** - Adds metadata, categories, and tags
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Basic sentiment scoring for articles
- **Trend Detection** - Identifies emerging topics and patterns

### Integration Points
- **N8N Workflows** - Fully integrated with automation platform
- **BigQuery Export** - Structured data export for analytics
- **Notification System** - Alerts for high-priority news
- **Daily Digest** - Automated summary generation

## Technical Architecture

### Workflow Components
```yaml
News_Tracker/
â”œâ”€â”€ sources/           # News source configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ filters/          # Content filtering rules
â”œâ”€â”€ processors/       # Data transformation logic
â”œâ”€â”€ exports/          # Output formatting
â””â”€â”€ schedules/        # Cron job configurations
```

### Data Flow
1. **Source Polling** â†’ Every 30 minutes
2. **Content Extraction** â†’ Parse and structure
3. **Filtering & Deduplication** â†’ Remove noise
4. **Enrichment** â†’ Add metadata
5. **Distribution** â†’ Send to various endpoints

## N8N Integration

### Workflow Triggers
- **Schedule Trigger** - Regular polling intervals
- **Webhook Trigger** - Real-time source updates
- **Manual Trigger** - On-demand processing

### Connected Workflows
- **Daily Energizer** - Feeds morning digest content
- **Content Analysis** - Provides data for trend analysis
- **Alert System** - Triggers notifications for keywords

## Use Cases Implemented

### Business Intelligence
- Competitor monitoring
- Industry trend tracking
- Market sentiment analysis
- Regulatory news alerts

### Content Creation
