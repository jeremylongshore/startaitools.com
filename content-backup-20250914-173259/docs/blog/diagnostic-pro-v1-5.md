# DiagnosticPro v1.5 - Medical Platform MVP

**Status:** üóÑÔ∏è Archived (Early Version)
**Period:** August - September 2025
**Tech Stack:** SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, Google Cloud (BigQuery, Firestore, Storage)
**Location:** `/projects/archived/DiagnosticPro-v1.5/` (Read-Only)

## Project Overview

DiagnosticPro v1.5 represents an early attempt at building a comprehensive medical diagnostic platform. This version focused on migrating from a traditional web stack to SvelteKit for improved performance and developer experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **Medical Diagnostic Forms** - Comprehensive patient intake system
- **AI Integration** - Early integration with diagnostic AI models
- **Payment Processing** - Stripe integration for subscription management
- **Cloud Infrastructure** - Full Google Cloud Platform integration

### Technical Achievements
- **SvelteKit Migration** - Successfully migrated core components to SvelteKit
- **Playwright Testing** - Comprehensive E2E test suite with multiple test profiles
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration for live data

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend
- **Framework:** SvelteKit chosen for its performance and DX
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- **Testing:** Playwright for comprehensive E2E testing

### Backend
- **Database:** BigQuery for analytics, Firestore for real-time data
- **Storage:** Google Cloud Storage for medical documents
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth with custom claims
- **Payments:** Stripe for subscription management

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **SvelteKit Performance** - Significant improvement in page load times
2. **Playwright Testing** - Caught many issues before production
3. **Component Architecture** - Reusable component system proved valuable
4. **TypeScript Integration** - Type safety prevented many runtime errors

### Challenges Faced
1. **Complexity Growth** - Feature scope expanded beyond initial MVP
2. **State Management** - SvelteKit stores became complex at scale
3. **Medical Compliance** - HIPAA requirements added significant complexity
4. **Migration Effort** - Converting existing codebase took longer than expected

## Why It Was Archived

The project was archived to make way for DiagnosticPro v2.0, which takes a different architectural approach:
- Simplified feature set for true MVP
- API-first architecture instead of monolithic SvelteKit
- Microservices approach for better scalability
- Focus on core diagnostic features before expanding

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- SvelteKit 1.x
- Tailwind CSS 3.x
- Google Cloud SDK
- Stripe SDK
- Playwright Test Framework

## Migration Path

For developers looking to continue this work:
1. Review the codebase in `/projects/archived/DiagnosticPro-v1.5/`
2. Consider lessons learned above
3. Check DiagnosticPro v2.0 for current approach
4. Many components can be reused with modifications

## Related Projects

- **DiagnosticPro v2.0** - Current version with simplified architecture
- **diagnostic-platform** - Original platform before SvelteKit migration
- **diagnostic-pro-mvp3** - Earlier MVP iteration

## Archive Status

This project is archived and set to **read-only** to preserve the codebase for reference. It represents an important learning phase in the platform's evolution and contains valuable code that may be referenced or reused in future iterations.
